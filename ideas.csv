","Financial companies operating in this format offer innovative solutions for those who want to own a car or home. This approach plays a significant role in eliminating people's financial difficulties and meeting their living conditions and transportation needs.

One of the main ideas is to offer favorable terms to own a home through interest-free loans and long-term payment plans. This is a significant advantage compared to traditional bank loans and helps to solve housing problems for a wide population segment. Through group savings and cooperative management principles, participants collectively accumulate funds and take turns owning homes. Transparency and trust are central to this format. Participants are regularly informed about payments and project stages, which helps gain their trust.

A similar principle is applied to owning a car. People can acquire the car they desire through long-term and interest-free loans. This approach offers more favorable conditions to meet people's transportation needs and simplify their daily lives. The funds collected through group savings are used for purchasing cars and distributed among participants in turn.

In both areas, the effective management of participants' information is ensured through the application of modern technologies. Monitoring payments, project stages, and maintaining constant communication with participants is possible through digital platforms. This ensures projects are completed on time and with high quality.

Here are the problems targeted by the project, detailed in bullet points:

Time Constraints for Busy Individuals: Many car owners struggle to find the time for car maintenance due to hectic schedules. Balancing work, family, and personal commitments leaves little room for tasks like car washes, oil changes, and service appointments.

Inconvenience of Traditional Car Maintenance: The traditional process of car maintenance involves scheduling appointments, waiting in line, or leaving the car at the service center for hours or even days. This inconvenience can discourage regular maintenance, leading to more significant issues down the line.

Lack of Trust in Service Providers: There's a prevalent concern among consumers about the transparency and reliability of car service providers. Fear of overcharging, unnecessary services, or subpar work can deter owners from timely maintenance.

Neglect of Routine Maintenance: Due to the aforementioned reasons, routine maintenance can often be neglected. According to a survey by the CarCare among the 50 car masters, 30% of vehicles have low or dirty engine oil, and 20% have dirty air filters. Such neglect can reduce a vehicle's efficiency, lifespan, and safety, leading to costly repairs.

Lack of Customized Service Options: Car owners have varied needs based on their vehicle type, usage, and personal preferences. Traditional service centers often offer a one-size-fits-all solution, which may not cater to individual needs effectively.

The product offers a financial product that combines a deposit card with cashback/mile bonuses, providing customers with income and convenience in daily use. The main goal of the product is to make customers' financial activities more profitable and appealing, as well as to expand the customer base of the banks.

Key Principles of the Business Model and Revenue Sources:
Interest Revenues:

Customers receive an annual 1% interest based on the amount held on the card (monthly 0.83%). These interests are credited to the customer's card with the designation 'SmartSave Rewards' at the end of each month.
Based on the deposits on the card, the bank generates interest income. In addition to paying deposit interests, the bank can use the stored funds for other investment and credit operations.
Cashback and Mile Bonuses:

Customers earn cashback or mile bonuses from their card transactions. The cashbacks are accumulated under the designation 'SmartSave Rewards' in the customer's account and are paid back with additional interest to the customers.
Mile bonuses offer travel experiences to customers and are designed to attract travelers.
Revenue Source for Banks: Accumulating cashback and mile bonuses can bring additional income to the bank through payments networks and collaborations. For example, contracts and trade fees with the commercial points where customers shop will contribute to the bank's revenue.",https://rready-files-prd.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/PASHAHolding%2FPASHAHolding-kickbox-1648%2Fimage%2F21054bf4-a50b-42c1-a269-644eb60a9ed8,,"Our idea is an innovative financial product that offers customers not only deposit interest, but also cashback and mile bonuses. This product allows customers to not only earn income related to bank deposits, but also gain additional benefits in their shopping and travels. Monthly interest calculations, a simple and transparent bonus system, as well as advantages tailored to different social strata increase customer satisfaction. Customers receive different bonuses and offers for each task, which binds them to the product and creates a new customer base.

This product resolves many problems and difficulties for both customers and banks in the market. It fills existing gaps in the market, ensuring better service conditions for customers. The product actually offers a solution that combines many useful features, appeals to customers, and is tailored to different social strata.

1. Aligning Interest Rates and Deposit Products with Challenges
Problem: There are very few bank cards in Azerbaijan that calculate deposit interest, and the interest rates on bank deposits are often low. Moreover, if the contract is breached, the interest is either not paid or paid in a very small amount, leading customers to show less interest. High-interest deposit products usually bring higher returns with larger amounts or longer durations, not accessible to every customer.
Challenge: Existence of term contracts, interest losses due to contract terms, or low interest rates making deposit products unattractive to customers, ultimately making it difficult for banks to expand their customer base.
Solution: With this card, customers start with an annual 1% deposit interest, which is automatically calculated at a monthly rate of 0.83%. In addition to deposits, customers also receive cashback and mile bonuses monthly. This not only attracts customers with attractive interest rates but also allows them to earn additional benefits when shopping. For example, if a customer deposits 1000 AZN and the deposit completes 30 days (1 month), they earn 8-10 AZN interest each month, and the interest they earn, credited to their cards with the designation 'SmartSave Rewards,' allows them to receive additional interest, as well as receive cashback from their purchases, all deposited to their deposit card with the 'SmartSave Rewards' designation, which brings in additional interest, allowing customers to save smartly without any difficulty.","[{""id"":""1"",""label"":""Pasha Holding""},{""id"":""2"",""label"":""Kapital Bank""},{""id"":""3"",""label"":""PASHA Bank""},{""id"":""7"",""label"":""Competo (Umico)""}]","This project will create strategic synergy for PAŞA Bank, Kapital Bank, and Umico, expanding the customer base of all three institutions.

How It Works:
Each employee receives 20 meals/month, priced at 10 manat per meal.
Total cost: 200 manat/month per employee.
Split Payment Structure:
Company pays 100 manat (50%) as a corporate benefit.
Employee pays 100 manat (50%) when they use the service to purchase meals.

Revenue Sources:
Commission Fee from Restaurants:
Munchly charges a tiered commission fee (20-30%) on each meal sold, based on the number of orders from the restaurant in a month. 
Commission Fee Breakdown
1–5 Orders: Munchly charges 20% commission per meal.
6–10 Orders: Munchly charges 25% commission per meal.
11–20 Orders: Munchly charges 30% commission per meal.

Unused Meals:
If an employee does not use all their 20 meals in a month, Munchly retains the unused portion of the company's contribution (100 manat).",https://rready-files-prd.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/PASHAHolding/ai/generated/70741a5b-6675-4766-b88a-fec4697051a6.png,,"Our business model is designed to offer flexibility, affordability, and mutual benefit for employees, companies, and restaurants. Here's how it works:
Each participating restaurant provides a special lunch menu priced at 10 manat. Through Munchly, we offer this menu to companies as an employee perk. The company pays 5 manat for each meal on behalf of the employee, while the remaining 5 manat is paid by the employee.
Employees have the freedom to customize their meal box by selecting menus from different restaurants each month. They enjoy 20 meals per month, perfectly aligning with the average number of workdays, all while keeping the cost per meal at just 5 manat.
This way:
•	Employees get affordable and flexible lunch options from a variety of restaurants.
•	Companies enhance employee satisfaction with a low-cost, valuable perk. 
•	Restaurants can analyze their customer's behaviors.","Throughout both my professional and academic life, I have shown a keen interest in various fields and a strong desire to learn new things.

Corporate Employee Retention and Satisfaction: Companies struggle to find cost-effective ways to enhance employee perks. Munchly offers an easy-to-implement lunch subsidy program that boosts satisfaction and productivity.

Low Lunchtime Demand for Restaurants: Restaurants often experience inconsistent or low traffic during lunch hours. Munchly connects them to corporate clients, ensuring steady and predictable revenue.

By offering a meal program for employees, we can enhance collaboration between these subsidiaries, driving innovation and employee engagement. For example, PASHA Bank and PASHA Life employees could benefit from the subsidized meal program, improving their overall satisfaction and productivity. Additionally, this initiative can strengthen internal partnerships and open up cross-business opportunities, furthering PASHA Group’s commitment to fostering an interconnected, efficient, and innovative corporate ecosystem.","Munchly: monthly lunch subscription service designed for employees, where companies partially subsidize meals, creating a win-win solution for employees, employers, and restaurants.","Our unique value proposition lies in offering a convenient and affordable lunch solution for employees while simultaneously benefiting companies and restaurants. The key differentiator is our flexible, employee-focused meal program, where employees pay only a portion of the cost (5 manat) for their daily lunch menu, while companies subsidize the rest. Additionally, employees have the freedom to select meals from different restaurants each month, creating variety and excitement. This subscription-based model provides a predictable and cost-effective solution for both employees and companies.

Currently, there are no direct competitors offering a similar service to ours in the Azerbaijani market. While global companies like MealPal, Peach, and Sharebite provide comparable solutions, we have a unique opportunity to be the first mover in Azerbaijan.

Locally, our indirect competitors include traditional catering systems that offer services to corporates, as well as individual restaurants. However, these models often lack flexibility and meal variety, which we provide by offering employees the ability to select from a range of restaurants each month.

Additionally, we have a significant advantage over restaurants because our service offers lunch at a lower price point. While employees typically pay 5 manat for a meal, restaurants are still guaranteed a steady stream of orders, and companies also benefit from subsidizing part of the cost. This makes our service more affordable compared to dining directly at restaurants, while also offering employees more variety.

By being the first to introduce this innovative model in Azerbaijan, we have the advantage of establishing strong relationships with corporate clients and local restaurants, positioning us as the go-to solution for corporate meal programs. This first-mover advantage allows us to capture market share early, build brand recognition, and drive long-term growth in an underserved market.",

Solving existing challenges is crucial not only for improving customer experience but also for strengthening Pasha Holding's overall business strategy. The main reasons for solving these challenges and their importance are explained below:

1. Creation of a Unified Platform 
Why is it important? Currently, Pasha Holding's various companies operate independently, and customers have to use separate applications. This leads to time loss, confusion, and discomfort for customers.

2. Increasing Cross-Selling Potential 
Why is it important? Due to the lack of information exchange between separate applications and systems, companies cannot fully utilize cross-selling opportunities. Low cross-selling potential leads to revenue losses.

3. Synchronization and Unified Data Usage 
Why is it important? With customer information stored in different databases in current systems, the analysis and usage of data become challenging. This hinders proper analysis of customer behaviors and the establishment of targeted marketing strategies.

4. Enhancing Customer Satisfaction 
Why is it important? Different interfaces and user experiences in various applications create confusion for customers and deteriorate user experience. This may lead customers to switch to other competing companies.

5. Improving Operational Efficiency 
Why is it important? The lack of connection between various systems and applications also leads to inefficiency and time loss in internal operations. This prolongs response times to customer queries and causes additional costs for the company.

6. Gaining Competitive Advantage 
Why is it important? Competition is strong in fields such as banking, insurance, and investment. Customers are always looking for better and more convenient services. If Pasha Holding offers different services on separate platforms to customers, competing companies will gain a competitive edge with unified platforms.

o Merchants create digital coupons and assign a specific number of points (Y) to each
coupon.
o Each point costs USD X.
2.⁠ ⁠Customer Interaction:
o Customers visit a merchant's store and scan the digital coupon, earning Y points.
o The merchant's balance is debited by USD X*Y for each scan.
3.⁠ ⁠Gaming Mechanism:
o Customers use the points to participate in games. In our business model each game
costs 10 points, so Y equals 10 points per game.
o Games occur every 5 minutes, with customers gathering to compete in real-time.
4.⁠ ⁠Revenue Generation:
o Example Scenario: If 1,000 customers join a game within 5 minutes, the total points
in the game are 1,000*10=10,000.
o Jiff collects awarding amount based on the total points and cost per point: in our
example scenario it is USD 10,000*X.
5.⁠ ⁠Distribution of Collected Amount:
o For each game, Jiff collects: USD (Number of participants in the game) * (Points
per game) * (Cost per point).
o Using the example, the calculation is: USD 1,000 * 10 * X.
o The distribution of the collected amount is as follows:
▪ Winning Customer: 50% of the total collected amount.
▪ Merchant (where the winning customer's last coupon was scanned):
45% of the total collected amount.
▪ Jiff's Revenue: 5% of the total collected amount.

Project Description The project will be a platform for the application and printing of designs on any desired products for project, corporate, and individual orders. The goal is to enhance the brand value of customers by offering unique and customized products. 1. Market Analysis Increasing Demand: The number of companies and brands in Azerbaijan is increasing. Especially, the corporate sector (banks, educational institutions, tourism, and hospitality) requires more specialized products to strengthen their brand image. Competitive Advantage: The demand for specialized brand products is increasing for customers to be chosen in competition. This also increases the relevance of your idea. Gift Culture: Corporate gifts are common in Azerbaijan (for special days, events) and this strengthens interest in such a service. 2. Feasibility and Profitability of the Idea Strengthening Corporate Image: Corporate attire, branded products, and unique designs ensure that companies appear more professional to customers and partners. For example, the branded attire of bank employees signals reliability to customers. Brand Recognition: Through branded products (mugs, bags, clothing), companies become more recognized among customers and partners. Profitable Sectors: Especially large corporations and government institutions always place large orders. There is a constant demand for events, promotions, and gifts. For example, if a bank orders corporate uniforms for 1,000 employees, this can bring in significant revenue. Another example is gifts for corporate events. 3. Probability of Success The key factors that increase the likelihood of success of your idea are: Low Competition: There are very few companies offering such services in the Azerbaijani market. With a new and creative approach, you can establish a strong position in the market. Technology and Quality: By applying the most modern printing technologies, you can maintain the quality of your products at a high level. This will lead customers to prefer you. Customer Satisfaction: By providing orders in a timely and high-quality manner, you can build long-term customer relationships. Continuity: Companies will not order just once, they will place orders frequently. Corporate gifts and attire are renewed continuously. 4. Examples of Successful Ideas 1.	Foreign Examples: Vistaprint (USA): A platform that offers special print products to small businesses. Currently, it has a billion-dollar turnover. Zazzle (USA): This platform, famous for personalized design products, offers fully customized products to its customers. 2.	Azerbaijani Example: Several local companies (e.g., advertising agencies) offer branded products, but this service is narrow and not technological. Our idea can fill this gap with modern technology and a personalized approach. 5. Benefits of Gaining Competitive Advantage for Customers Increased Recognition: Branded products introduce the brand to a wider audience. Modern and Innovative Image: Special clothing and products demonstrate the company's modernity. Customer Loyalty: Quality corporate gifts create positive impressions among customers. For example, a branded bag from a hotel helps the customer remember that brand. 6. Offers and Future Perspectives Focused Marketing: Banks, tourism sector, and large corporations within Azerbaijan could be your main customer base. New Product Offerings: By adding technology-related products (e.g., USB flash drives, power banks), you can expand your customer base. Eco-Friendly Products: You can offer ecological clean products to bring innovation to the market. Conclusion Such a service has great potential in Azerbaijan. Proper planning and a modern approach can make this business both profitable and successful in the long run.

Vendors and service providers then receive these requests and offer tailored solutions. The platform supports both tangible products (e.g., electronics, home decor) and services (e.g., repair, maintenance), addressing a gap left by conventional online services. Integrated with Umico, a strategic asset of Pasha Holding, vendors can register via their Umico accounts, use its delivery services, and buyers can receive quick offers from Umico products and redeem Umico bonuses.

However, the main difference is that the value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate sharply based on market conditions, including possible depreciation. Since BirGold is based on gold, the possibility of its physical value depreciating sharply is much lower. Furthermore, an annual interest is calculated on the deposit amount through the embedded NFC chip, which allows the value of BirGold to increase over time.

1) Interest revenues on deposits: Customers can deposit starting from 50 AZN. The interest rate varies depending on the deposit amount. The interest rates are conditionally as follows:

Between 50 - 500 AZN annual 2.5%
Between 500 - 2000 AZN annual 3.5%
Between 2000 - 5000 AZN annual 5%

The customer will receive interest income according to the deposit amount and can track and cash out this income through the BirBank application. The principal amount, however, cannot be cashed out. This provides a stable income for the platform.

2) Gold sales and price difference: BirGold product is sold, and customers must also deposit additional funds. The BirGold product is valued at 850 AZN gold, and the customer will pay 900 AZN with a minimum 50 AZN deposit. This sale generates revenue.

3) Integrated services: Through digital integration between BirGold and the BirBank application, additional financial services can be offered to customers, such as analyses and investment-oriented offers.

The research indicates that approximately 60% of gold buyers store it at home, increasing the risk of theft and loss. 
-Storing traditional gold is risky and requires special conditions. BirGold ensures security with bank guarantees and digital tracking.

2) Liquidity problem of gold:

Global gold liquidity indicators show that selling physical gold can result in an average loss of 5-10% of its value. 
-BirGold users can partially ensure liquidity by converting interest revenue to cash at any time. In other words, customers receive interest income through the deposit embedded chip in BirGold and can cash it out using the BirBank application. The principal amount, however, is not cashed out.

3) Difficulty in gold investment with small amounts:
-BirGold requires a minimum deposit of 50 AZN, in addition to the product's value, raising the entry barrier for customers. This amount can be increased according to the customer's capabilities and enables earning interest income.

4) Payment and usability convenience:

Digital payments have increased by 200% in Azerbaijan in the last 3 years, but physical gold cannot keep up with this trend. 
-It is not possible to use physical gold as a payment method. However, through the BirGold chip, customers can manage the deposit amount and track interest income in the BirBank application.

5) Incompatibility of customizable financial products for gifts:

According to conducted research, 70% of people who give gold as gifts choose it for weddings, engagements, and other special occasions. BirGold is an ideal gift for both special occasions and daily use with its elegant, modern design, and customization option.

2) Gold investment opportunity with small amounts: BirGold addresses the issue of traditional gold investments requiring large amounts.

Many people face challenges during this process, and some end up wasting years in fields they do not enjoy due to wrong choices. I have faced the same challenge myself, spending six years to find my current specialization. In life, there is nothing more valuable than time. My greatest motivation is to save time for others, guide them on the right path, and be a map for their career journey. This approach inspired our slogan: ""We are here to be your roadmap on the career path.""

This experience showed me that without proper guidance and support, people can waste a lot of time and energy when choosing a specialization or starting a new field. Additionally, many people who are already in their chosen field wish to develop further but do not know what steps to take. MyRoad helps both those wishing to switch fields and those wanting to become professionals in their current area by providing AI-based career coaching, structured roadmaps, and mentorship support to help them find the most suitable and successful career path.","[{""id"":""1"",""label"":""Yes""}]","[{""id"":""1"",""label"":""Yes""}]",+994502235720,"1. Uncertainty and Wrong Decisions in Career Choice

Many people struggle to make the right career choice, and the main reasons for this are lack of information, absence of proper guidance, or making wrong decisions due to external influences. Speaking from my personal experience, when I finished high school, I didn't know which career path to choose, and with my family's guidance, I ended up in fire safety. Later, I realized that I couldn't find myself in this field, so I tried architecture, graphic design, and front-end development. However, only after discovering UX design did I feel at ease in my chosen field.

- Many people struggle with university choice, are dissatisfied with their current field or job.
- People often lack information when choosing a career they will dedicate the rest of their lives to.
- Due to wrong guidance, many waste years in fields that don't suit them.

How does MyRoad help?

- By engaging with a specially designed AI career coach, users can choose a career that aligns with their skills and interests.
- Detailed roadmaps are provided for the chosen field, showing users what knowledge they need to acquire and how to learn it.
- With mentor support, users get the opportunity to meet with experienced professionals and make informed decisions.

2. Lack of Knowledge on How to Develop in a Career

Some individuals are already working in a particular field, but they are unsure about the steps they need to take to further develop and become professionals. This prevents them from fully realizing their potential.

How does MyRoad solve this problem?

- The AI career coach offers a personalized career development plan.
- Professional and tool roadmaps show users which knowledge and skills need to be acquired in order to specialize.
- Mentorship from professionals working at major companies (Pasha Holding, Microsoft, Meta, etc.) provides users with the opportunity to strengthen their weak areas and advance to higher positions. Note: Initially, I will invite experts from large foreign companies through my own networking.","[{""id"":""1"",""label"":""Pasha Holding""}]","PASHA Group has a wealth of highly skilled professionals whose expertise is invaluable. MyRoad creates a mentorship ecosystem by connecting these experts with employees working in other companies within PASHA Group. Through this platform, employees will be able to receive professional mentorship and develop their careers and skills. Meanwhile, mentors will not only share their knowledge but also gain additional income opportunities. MyRoad strengthens knowledge and experience exchange within PASHA Group, ensuring faster and more effective employee development, ultimately contributing to the overall enhancement of the group's human capital.

MyRoad brings together professionals both inside and outside of PASHA Group to create a strong mentorship ecosystem. PASHA Group employees can benefit not only from internal experts but also from mentors working in global companies such as Microsoft and Meta. This enables them to enhance their knowledge and skills at an international level.

Additionally, the mentorship support offered through PASHA Group’s Kickbox program can be facilitated via MyRoad. The company can allocate a dedicated mentorship budget for each team, allowing them to receive support from any mentor they choose based on their needs. This approach will make innovation and knowledge exchange more systematic and effective, contributing to the development of both employees and PASHA Group as a whole.","We provide support with AI coaching, roadmaps, and mentorship for those who are unable to choose a career path and for those who wish to develop in their current field.","Our platform has no full alternative, not only in Azerbaijan but also globally. There are platforms that offer specific career-related services, but they focus only on certain stages of the career journey and provide a single-directional approach.

For example, platforms like [roadmap.sh](http://roadmap.sh/) share career roadmaps, while [Hirelamp.co](http://hirelamp.co/) and ADPList offer mentorship opportunities. However, each of these platforms serves a specific and narrow purpose:

[Roadmap.sh](http://roadmap.sh/) focuses solely on providing career roadmaps and roadmap-building services.
ADPList and [Hirelamp.co](http://hirelamp.co/) help users connect with experts for mentorship.

Our platform offers an ecosystem that aims to support all individuals (whether they are just starting out in their field, want to improve in this field, want to change their field, or don't know which field to choose) from A to Z, serving as a map on their career path, and walking with us.

With our platform, our users can connect with AI for career advice when needed, receive advice from professionals through mentorship, or develop themselves by looking at both specialty and tool-specific roadmaps to see how they need to develop in the field.

We don’t just provide information—we walk the career journey together with our users as their guide.
Our main goal is to start in the Azerbaijani market, develop, and then open up globally, illuminating the career path of people all over the world, regardless of country.",

Fraud Roulette is an innovative, real-time call diversion app that connects engaged community members to potential scam calls targeting bank clients. When a fraudster attempts to call a real customer, the system reroutes the call to one of our active app users — volunteers who’ve opted in to act as “decoys.”

These users know in advance that they are speaking with a scammer. Their mission:

Protect the actual customer by absorbing the scam call.

Waste as much of the fraudster’s time as possible, because time is a scammer’s most valuable resource.

After each call, the app shows the user how many minutes they’ve “stolen” from the scammer, celebrates their success, and updates a leaderboard system. Users earn recognition, status, and rewards based on their impact — making it fun, social, and meaningful.

By combining technology, real-time telecom integration, and community gamification, we turn fraud-fighting into a nationwide movement. Citizens don’t just protect themselves — they protect each other.

Key Benefits:

Real-time fraud interception

Customer safety and awareness

Community empowerment

Fraudster deterrence through time loss

Scalable and gamified user engagement

Beynəlxalq Hava Nəqliyyatı Assosiasiyasının (IATA) məlumatına görə, sərnişinlərin 60%-i səyahət zamanı yorğunluq və stressdən şikayət edir.
Azərbaycanda isə hava limanları və mərkəzi vağzallarda bu ehtiyac üçün heç bir qısa-müddətli rahatlanma xidməti yoxdur.
Şəhər həyatında yüksək stress və enerji itkisi
Ofis işçiləri və tələbələr uzun iş/oxu saatlarından sonra diqqət və məhsuldarlıq itkisi yaşayır.
Harvard Business Review-un araşdırmasına görə, 20 dəqiqəlik “power nap” insanın məhsuldarlığını 34%, diqqətini isə 54% artırır.
Azərbaycanda bu ehtiyac ancaq kafelərdə və ya iş yerlərində qeyri-ideal formada qarşılanır.
Otel və hostellərin əlverişsizliyi
Otellər bahalıdır və qısa müddət üçün istifadə etmək mümkün deyil.

Differentiating Features •	Design: Pods made of minimalist, premium materials. •	Features: Soundproof environment, light therapy, aromatherapy, comfortable music choices. •	Brand Message: ""Find Serenity, Renew Your Energy."" 3. Target Audience •	Travelers (airports, train stations) •	Office workers (business centers, co-working spaces) •	Tourists and premium clients •	Corporate clients (packages for worker welfare) 4. Innovative Services •	Reservation and payment via mobile app •	Subscription models - for daily/monthly use •	Sereni Premium experience - special aromatherapy, relaxing music, individual choices •	Advertising and sponsorship opportunities 5. Investor Message ""Sereni Pod is not just for sleep; it is a wellness technology reducing city life stress and giving people energy. It will be introduced in Azerbaijan for the first time and will open a new era in tourism, business, and public services.""  Sereni Pod - The New Address of Serenity and Energy Imagine: You've come to the airport for an early morning flight. Your eyes are tired, a busy meeting awaits you, but there is no energy. There are thousands of people around, but not a single corner for rest. You want to relax, gather your thoughts - but there's no time to go to a hotel, and there is neither quiet nor comfort in the cafe. It's in this gap that Sereni Pod emerges. Sereni Pod is not just a ""sleep capsule."" It is a unique space concept that provides serenity, energy, and balance to people in the city's noise. These small but intelligently designed capsules are intended to revive people in a short time.  What Will It Offer People? •	20-30 minutes of relaxation - enhancing productivity and concentration. •	Escape from stress - with soothing music, aromatherapy, lighting, and silence. •	Cleanliness and safety - UV-C disinfection, clean air system, fully hygienic environment. •	Convenience - reservation with just a few clicks via the mobile app without the need for a hotel. Sereni Pod brings comfort, health, and balance to people.  Why Will It Succeed? The world is changing rapidly. The greatest value of people is time and energy. Every day, thousands of people - travelers, businessmen, students - need a short break within the city. Hotels and hostels do not solve this problem: •	Hotels - require expensive and long-term booking. •	Hostels - do not provide personal privacy and comfort. Sereni Pod is different. It is a personal comfort space within the city.  Why Is There Demand? •	Airports, train stations - long waiting hours. •	Business centers - tired office workers. •	Universities - students need to focus. •	Tourism - travelers' need for relaxation. In other words, Sereni Pod can become an essential part of daily life for both locals and tourists.  Revenue Model •	Main revenue: short-term 20-60 minute usage fee. •	Additional revenues: o	Subscription packages (monthly packages for corporate companies) o	Advertising and sponsorship opportunities (inside the pods and in the mobile app) o	Premium experiences (aromatherapy, music choices, meditation sessions) Requires an investment of 40-80 million dollars for 10 pods in the pilot phase. Estimated monthly revenue is around 9-10 million AZN, net profit will range between 3-5 million AZN. The return on investment is possible within 1 year.  Sereni Pod - The Beginning of a New Culture This project is not just a business. It is a new lifestyle that will be introduced for the first time in Azerbaijan. A service that provides peace, health, and energy to people, adding value to tourism and city infrastructure. And for an investor, Sereni Pod means: •	unique concept, •	opportunity to be first, •	quick returns and high growth potential.  Sereni Pod will provide people with a few minutes of tranquility. But this tranquility will change their day, productivity, and quality of life.","Sereni Pod – Unikal Dəyər Təklifi

Sereni Pod-un unikal dəyəri ondadır ki, o, sadəcə “yuxu otağı” deyil, rahatlıq, meditasiya və enerji bərpasını birləşdirən tam bir wellness təcrübəsidir. Rəqiblər yalnız yatmaq üçün kapsul təklif etdiyi halda, Sereni Pod fərqli olaraq:
Premium və minimalist dizayn – yüksək komfort, tam məxfilik və estetik mühit.
Çoxfunksiyalı təcrübə – səsizləşdirilmiş mühit, işıq terapiyası, aroma diffuzor və sakit musiqi.
Texnologiya inteqrasiyası – mobil tətbiq ilə rezervasiya, ödəmə, abunəlik modelləri.
Əlavə gəlir və xidmətlər – reklam, korporativ paketlər, premium seçimlər.
Azərbaycanda ilk olmaq üstünlüyü – bazarda rəqib yoxdur, eksklüzivlik imkanı var.
Sereni Pod insanlara “şəhərin içində şəxsi sakitlik məkanı” təqdim edir. Bu isə onu otel, hostel və digər alternativlərdən fərqləndirən əsas dəyərdir.",

Azerbaijan's Alat port project alone is not sufficient for the region's logistics leadership. The Alat Project gains meaning regionally with the presence of a functioning logistics company that can engage in business and has business volume. Otherwise, the Alat project needs the capital and presence of foreign-funded logistics companies, which would make the Alat project less valuable for Azerbaijan than expected.

The current commission-based model used by popular ride-hailing apps leads to several challenges for both drivers and passengers:

Unreliable Service: Passengers often experience late arrivals and cancellations from drivers, leading to frustration and inconvenience.
Price Negotiations: Drivers resort to asking for cash payments or negotiating prices with passengers, disrupting the seamless ride experience and causing discomfort.
Low Earnings for Drivers: High commission rates eat into drivers' earnings, forcing them to prioritize high-paying rides and decline or cancel lower-paying ones.


Solution:
Our startup proposes a subscription-based model for drivers, eliminating the commission system and offering subscription plans with fixed fees for unlimited rides. Key features of our solution include:

- Subscription Plans: Drivers can choose from daily, weekly, or monthly subscription plans, paying a fixed fee for unlimited rides within the subscription period.

- Stable Income: By knowing their earnings upfront and eliminating commission deductions, drivers can enjoy a more stable income and focus on providing quality service.

- Transparent Pricing: Passengers benefit from transparent pricing with no negotiations or surprises, ensuring a seamless and fair ride experience.

- Cash and Online Payments: We offer both cash and online payment options for passengers, ensuring flexibility and convenience while also guaranteeing prompt payment to drivers.

Benefits:
Our innovative approach offers several benefits to both drivers and passengers:

- Improved Service Quality: With a stable income and no pressure to prioritize high-paying rides, drivers can focus on providing reliable and efficient service to passengers.

- Enhanced Passenger Experience: Passengers enjoy transparent pricing, timely arrivals, and a hassle-free ride experience without the need for price negotiations or cash payments.

- Increased Driver Satisfaction: By offering a fair and predictable income, our model boosts driver satisfaction, leading to lower turnover rates and higher retention.

- Market Differentiation: Our subscription-based model sets us apart from traditional commission-based ride-hailing apps, attracting both drivers and passengers looking for a fair and transparent alternative.


Calculation Example:
Let's consider a typical scenario for a taxi driver operating under the current commission-based model:

In 12 hours, the driver completes 25 rides at an average price of 5 AZN per ride.
-Total earnings: 125 AZN
-Commission paid to the app company (at 20-25%): 30 AZN
-Additional expenses (car rent, fuel, car maintenance, etc.): Variable (55-60 AZN)
-Net earnings for 12 hours: 30-35 AZN

In contrast, with our subscription-based model:

- Driver subscribes to a daily plan for 10 AZN, offering unlimited rides.

- With same ride amount in 12 hours, their net earnings remain 55-60 AZN, significantly higher than the commission-based model.

This calculation demonstrates how our subscription-based model ensures drivers earn more while providing a reliable and efficient service to passengers.","[{""label"":""Pasha Holding"",""id"":""1""},{""label"":""Kapital Bank"",""id"":""2""},{""label"":""PASHA Bank"",""id"":""3""},{""label"":""PASHA Technology"",""id"":""6""},{""label"":""PASHA Management Company"",""id"":""14""},{""label"":""Competo (Umico)"",""id"":""7""},{""label"":""Absheron Hotel Group"",""id"":""11""}]","Our innovative subscription-based model aligns with PASHA Group's commitment to fostering technological advancements and disrupting traditional industries.

The initial process in the project starts with the creation of the SELECT application. Information on how the respective application can be downloaded begins with being reflected in character-based advertisements on AzRes Airlines, our country's hotels, and other hotels wishing to become partners, tourism offices, restaurants, entertainment centers, and car rental offices. As we know, tourists entering our country arrive first at the airport through airlines. Tourists who have entered the country subsequently search for a service that they can use, such as a place to stay in our country's hotels, tourism offices for sightseeing, restaurants for meals, taxis, and car rentals, or think about how they can do all these if they are not available. At this time, the first desire of the visiting tourist is to connect to a Wi-Fi network, and then to select a suitable place to stay, a place to eat, to think about how to obtain transportation services in an honest way, and at fair prices. The creation of the mentioned program will serve to provide all these to the tourist. For this purpose, a Wi-Fi network should first be created at the airport and partners, and first 15 minutes should be free. When a tourist connects to the internet, he should be immediately presented with the advertisement of the application on his mobile phone and should be offered to download the application. When the application is downloaded and registered, it should be indicated that an additional 15 minutes will be given to the tourist with a one-time promo code. This way, the first desire of the tourist will be fulfilled at first. In general, there should be a possibility of 30 minutes of free use from the Wi-Fi network. After 30 minutes, information should be provided on the panel about the possibility of connecting for a fee. Within the application, a function for creating an e-sim with a paid QR specifically for the guest should be offered. Through this means, the guest should be given the option to use the e-sim specific to the application available to the guest. Only internet packages should be available and used for the person who receives this service through payment, and it should be created in accordance with the e-sim. Having this service will compel any tourist to use and recommend the application since it will facilitate the continuous and uninterrupted provision of the most needed difficulty during the travels of people visiting our country, which is the internet. This revenue will serve not only to cover the costs incurred but also to prevent any additional expenses. With this offer, we will fulfill the first desire of tourists and ensure the download of our application. Registration for the application should be possible through various ways such as gmail, mail, social network profiles, and even with a mobile number specific to any country. When the customer registers, the registration should be confirmed with a WhatsApp confirmation based on the registered mobile number, as not everyone may have roaming, otherwise, it should be confirmed via email in other cases. The principle of the application will serve tourists to use the services offered in our country. The customer can select a hotel, order a taxi through the application, obtain information about hotels, select restaurants, obtain information about the foods, visit places and use tourist services, rent a car as well. For the customer who obtains the application, the offer of a taxi or car rental will mean the realization of the second desire, and will lead us to continue with a more interesting journey. Taxi and car rental should be specific to the application. For all these mentioned services to be obtained, application download QRs should be distributed in AR Airlines at the country's entrance, hotels, tourism offices, restaurants, entertainment centers, and car rental offices. Because, after acquiring the customer, all services will be provided through the application. The created SELECT application will allow us to obtain services such as taxi services, hotel services, restaurant services, tours and entertainment, car rentals, as well as see the names and images of the offered services and products, and will facilitate obtaining detailed information with a single service. Through the application, the visiting guest will be able to select a duration for his visit and see appropriate offers. When the guest selects a taxi or car rental, in addition to that, high-rated hotels, restaurants, domestic tour packages, and entertainment centers are offered (as well as other offers suitable for your vacation). The guest, through the application, easily obtains the services and reservations he wants related to the application. Also, through the chat feature, he should be able to obtain any other desires, information he wants to get, and the necessary support. By looking at the reviews about the service to be obtained, he will be able to choose the better one, and he will see the high-rated service. Among the partners, strong competition will arise for the sake of the service quality. The customer will express his opinion, approach, and suggestions about the defense, and new ideas and successful methods will be selected and implemented, which will lead to the expansion of our application base, increasing the customer base, delivering any desired campaigns and innovations to customers, and creating a more convenient and attractive environment for partners who will cooperate with us. Anyone using our application can advertise any information anytime, both within the application, through email, and also through social networks, and attract to us.

Bu sahələr isə əsasən sosial sahibkarlıq və asudə vaxtın təşkili ilə bağlı olmuşdur. 
Hazırda təklif etdiyim ideyanın xüsusi sosial əhəmiyyəti mövcuddur. Bildiyimiz kimi, şəhərimizin ən böyük urban problemi parkinqdir, bu nə qədər vacib olsa da, təəssüf ki, hazırda həyata keçirilən dövlət proqramları və atılan addımlar bu problemi həll etmək üçün yetərli deyil. Ona görə bizneslər də öz növbəsində bu sosial problemin həll olunmasına tövhəsini verməklə, passiv saatlarını doldura, daha çox müştəri cəlb edə, küçələrdə qanunsuz parkinqin qarşısını sivil yolla ala bilərlər. Sürücülər isə öz növbəsində qıraqda, təhlükəli şəkildə, nəzarətsiz avtomobil saxlamaq əvəzinə daha yaxşı tariflə, səliqəli və təhlükəsiz şəkildə avtomobili parkinqlərdə saxlaya biləcək.

Currently, expensive courses are offered in the education market. Between 8-15 lessons are taught per month, with 2-3 times a week, and prices start from 100 AZN, going up to even 600 AZN. Despite the high price of this valuable course, the teacher who teaches the course receives 30% or 40% of the revenue from each student. Sometimes people want to test themselves in a new field, they are hesitant about whether they can learn the field and want to start initially without knowing how it will end, and end up enrolling in more expensive courses without understanding how it will turn out. This proposed online training project will ensure that people benefit from education at a more affordable price, guarantee that it will always be accessible to everyone. Given that this proposed application is organized online, the number of students per training can be considered to be 100 or more. Each training period is planned for 1 or in stages. Each training cycle consists of at least 1.5 hours of training for 1 period, consisting of 5 lessons. Training fees are in the price range of 10-40 AZN. The user selects the training they will attend and registers. When joining the training, the training time, days, and hours are specified. If the user cannot participate for any reason, they are provided with the video of that lesson in the training profile or they can listen to it in podcast format. The video and audio text of the lesson are added to the lesson profile. With this application, the participant who cannot attend the lesson can watch the lesson at any time. This application will be convenient for anyone who wants to self-develop, both by paying a lower price, being able to listen again, attracting better teachers, and for users who intend to test any field, they can test themselves in the desired field by getting training at a lower price. Additionally, a section must be included in the application for questions during live lessons and for each student to join with a microphone, this will lead to interesting discussions, answering the questions raised. It should be ensured that tests in line with the training materials are placed by the teacher of the training; 3 test quizzes (providing the opportunity for any number of tests) and a certification exam should be placed. In the certification exam, the user should be given the opportunity to take the exam only once and to receive a certificate if they score more than 80%. A student who pays for each training and receives training should be given the right to access the training profile for 30 days. A user who cannot obtain a certificate from the training should be able to watch and learn the training materials again within 30 days. In the next month, the trainer should enter the same profile, place the information of the new group and the start date of the training, and pass the next live trainings. Users can join again by paying to get new training. This rule will create conditions for further training of the trainer and will ensure regular participation of users. A user can receive a maximum of 5 trainings at the same time. The number of trainings that can be joined must consist of 5 training sessions. A user who has obtained a certificate or when the training period ends can select new trainings. A user should be able to create a certificate link in the form of a link and should be able to download the electronic version of the certificate in PDF format. The certificate must be arranged in the form of a certificate by payment, and can be presented to the user as a paid certificate (by courier or by mail). The program will ensure that the trainer earns more, pay commissions for using the program online, the lower price will make the program accessible to everyone. To create interest in the application, simple general trainings (resume creation, job interviews, conducting business with customers, body language, who is this) should be offered for free and QR codes should be added to teaching centers, schools, universities, and notebooks, textbooks, as well as stationery shops to quickly be available on everyone's phone. Users who obtain a certificate can be given bonus points for motivation, which can provide an opportunity in the future to receive other trainings for free.

To start, a team will be assembled to translate and dub material. The team will consist of 8-10 people: voice actors, editor, translator, IT professional. In the future, as the company grows, there will be several dubbing teams, which will help us translate and dub materials faster. 

As you know, Azerbaijani dubbing on TV channels is not very good, so I believe we can fix that and also earn from it.
The first 6 months after the site is created will need to be free. And afterwards, when there is a good base of movies and series, introduce a paid subscription. Also, a huge role will be given to advertising our site among the population.

For example:
2 AZN per month, and if you take a yearly subscription at once then 18 AZN for the year.
If there are 100,000 users, then annual revenues will be about 2 million manats.

You can also earn from advertising on the site, but this advertising must not be intrusive to the user.

The operation of the application will help to provide initial consultation services to people with discomfort regarding the health field and for carrying out examinations, no waiting time with online reservations, drug supply, and medical insurance sales. With the initial information obtained through the online platform in the application, a preliminary assessment is made based on this information and assistance is provided to the citizen as to which field to initially address. The mentioned service is provided to citizens by the operators as information character without charging any service fees. This free service provided will increase customer engagement with the application and help them obtain the information they seek in a short time. With the information provided by the platform, the customer can choose the appropriate doctor for their problem. The citizen who selects the doctor should be able to see the proximity distance of the clinic and should be able to write for reception. The reception writing process should be possible with payment or insurance payment. Additionally, in the profile, it should be possible to see if the clinic works with insurance and selecting insurance should be possible. Information about the insurance packages offered with the insurance selection should be reflected. When choosing the insurance package, the citizen should have the opportunity to choose the services to receive, their value, and activation. The sale of insurance packages should be possible with loans or credit card payments. After choosing to split the payments or activate the credit application, the customer is faced with payment offers in 3 forms: Pay with card, pay in installments, get credit links. Single payments are sometimes very difficul...costs for all users. An installation that everyone can own will also increase the enlightenment and sales in insurance sales. This mentioned sales direction will create conditions for insurance companies to attract new corporate customers, to create conditions for clinics to work with them. Because the insured customer is a real sale, and in addition to that, the discounts provided for those not covered by insurance and becoming insured will further increase people's applications in this form of insurance.
The application that is mentioned should attract attention of clinics, citizens, and doctors as the main reason is to allow citizens to go beyond business hours and receive service, avoid queuing, reserve it, be able to receive payments, will provide services for no waiting, and provide services for drug supply and medical insurance.

During citizen registration, the citizen must register with mobile number and Fin code. At this time, the customer must receive a structured customer registration number form. Customer applications and all information about the customer must be structured in the single application database. The citizen should be able to see the information about their applications and documents in my documents section. It should be possible to note the customer's email address in the profile and add social network profile links. Since all information about the customer is reflected in the profile, the doctor can examine the patient based on the information provided without the need for the patient to be re-registed. When applying to another doctor, the application should be carried out according to standard procedures (with payment).
The mentioned application should be supplemented with Pharmacy and Drug Delivery service. When selecting the pharmacy service, the names of the drug products offered in the general database should be reflected. Citizens should be able to obtain information about the list of pharmacies where the searched medicine is available and the prices offered when searching the name of the searched medicine. When selecting the drug product, information should be provided about the pharmacy's address, contact details (email, phone, etc.), online platform, as well as the possibility to add files to the platform, delivery service, and instructions for using the product. Thus, the searching customer selects the drug, searches it, and at this time, decides on the offered pharmacies, the price of the preparation, the delivery service, the proximity distance, based on whether it has insurance or not. If there will be a delivery service, the customer should be informed in writing about it, and a service invoice for the price of the service and the delivery cost is presented to the customer.
By choosing the insurance services, the mentioned selection will introduce the customer to partner insurance companies, display products, partner clinics, partner pharmacies, contact details, offers, and complaints will be reflected. The written offers and complaints will form the rating of the insurance company and from the written reviews, they can get new ideas for themselves, new products, process optimization, and get ideas and work for increasing the quality of service. After the doctor admits the citizen, according to the relevant examinations, the diagnosis should be entered into the customer's profile based on the customer code, the company, and should locate own place in the profile according to the laboratory results.

Motivations include creating time convenience for people, providing more comfortable services, forming a centralized system and base in the medical field, explaining insurance to people, enlightening them, obtaining all desires more easily, obtaining information about insurance, the benefits of insurance to me, should I return to the doctor's appointment, where and how can I find a good doctor, I haven't found this medicine anymore, how long have I been looking for pharmacies, and how can I find the most affordable pharmacy near me, and other such questions that create problems will be eliminated.
Business model description: The mentioned application will attract and partner with clinics, pharmacies, health centers with a large number of corporate customers, and we will receive a commission from them for our service in return for customer engagement.
We can provide information about our insurance products, be informed about innovations and new ideas of competitors in the insurance market, and sell our products more by creating conditions for corporate insurance sales. Also, we can earn commission revenues through partnerships with other insurance companies.
By closely monitoring the entire Medical services market, compared to reality with better statistical figures, we can create new products, and offers according to customer demands.

In my work, I prioritize not just aesthetics, but also the overall user experience.

CreditOn solves these problems: now the customer simply needs to register with CreditOn and submit a loan request. Banks will then offer their credit options in response to the customer's request.

3. Flexibility: Customers have the opportunity to choose from offers from different banks, providing them with flexibility in determining loan conditions.

Examples of incorrect transfers:
1. When a person X transfers funds to a bank card belonging to Kapitalbank from any bank, payment systems (m10, E Pul, etc.), payment terminals (Million, Emanat, etc.), etc., if there is any error in the 16 digits of the card during the transfer, the funds go to a third party incorrectly, and the sender of the transfer must apply to bank X, the hotlines of payment systems and terminals, Kapitalbank ASC, law enforcement agencies, etc., for the funds to be returned to them, and this process takes a long time. 
The idea I will propose is that if the person transferring the funds knows the 16 digits of the card they are transferring, without compromising the bank secret, the customer can recover the erroneously transferred funds in a very short time without applying to the places mentioned above. 
Idea: A section for recovering mistakenly transferred funds is created in the OneBank mobile application. 
For example, if a customer of bank X, during a P2P operation to a card belonging to Kapitalbank ASC, enters a wrong digit when entering the 16 digits of the card, the funds are mistakenly sent to a third party, in this case, if the customer of bank X has the OneBank mobile application and a card belonging to Kapitalbank ASC, they log into the OneBank mobile app, go to the transfers section, enter the ""Recovery of mistakenly transferred funds"" field, select their own card, enter the 16 digits of the card where the transfer error occurred, attach a screenshot of the transfer queue, create a request related to the return of the funds to them (the third party), a notification is sent to the OneBank application of the person receiving the funds (third party) related to the issue I mentioned above (the notification only contains encrypted information such as amount, date, encrypted version of the applicant's card digits, etc.), and there are 2 options there: 
1. I return it.
2. I refuse.
When the recipient of the funds (third party) chooses the first option, the mistakenly transferred funds are returned to the customer's card at Kapitalbank ASC, and if they choose the second option, a notification is sent to the applicant's OneBank application stating ""the customer refused to return the funds, you can contact law enforcement agencies."" 
In addition, I would like to note that within the last 3 months of 2023, more than 1200 total incorrect transfer requests were received by Kapitalbank ASC customer services.

Competitors and our differences:

The proposed platform is not available in the Azerbaijani market, however, there are 2 active sites similar to the idea (Oxuyan.az and Otk.az). In Oxuyan.az and Otk.az projects, applicants only participate in exam tests. Additional services are not offered. Our project will have the following advantages compared to our competitors:
  1. Our platform will provide not only correct answers for tests but also explanations of lessons and incorrect test answers.
  2. In the Oxuyan.az platform, tests can be created by any individuals and whether there are mistakes in the created tests is not checked by the platform. In our project, tests will be checked beforehand and suitable tests for exam conducted by DIM will be placed.
  3. In their platforms, tests are prepared on the spot. In our project, tests will be systematically arranged for each subject and applicants will be able to participate in exam tests for as long as they wish by selecting subjects.
  4. Each applicant will be individually approached by presenting the test forms they are weak in based on their test results in the next exams. This feature does not exist in competitor platforms.
  5. Our prices are higher compared to our competitors (each test price is between 5-10 AZN), while the offered services are less. On the contrary, in our project, we offer lower prices and more comprehensive services.",

Affiliate Marketing is considered a new generation advertising strategy. It continues to rapidly expand in the global market with the development of the Internet and social networks. As an example, the Tendyol Influencer Program can be cited. This program is not a foreign concept in the Azerbaijani market and is successfully implemented by local market participants. Influencers from Azerbaijan, similar to the Tendyol Influencer Program, now share product links with their followers on Instagram, recommending these products for purchase. As a result, by clicking on the link and purchasing any product, influencers earn commission income. 

Unfortunately, local sellers and product owners have not yet taken advantage of this strategy to increase their sales. The fact that Umico, a well-known online store in our country, does not implement this system is a clear example of the gap in the local market. In addition, local stores do not offer such programs on their websites, nor are there networks in the domestic market that create such conditions for them. Therefore, the Fallin.link platform will be the first to try to eliminate this gap in the local market (acting as a type of Network).

Different from the traditional advertising method (pay to advertise my product approach), the assurance and effectiveness of this method and the reachability of the product to larger masses are considered the main advantages.

If we give an example from Azerbaijan, we may have witnessed that influencers usually share links on Instagram stories, and after a while, the story disappears as the time expires. When this happens, they are forced to repeatedly share the same (and new) product links. As a result, followers may become both fatigued and negatively inclined, as if the influencer needs to share a link every minute, and the products they share are no longer taken seriously by the followers. Moreover, in order to share influencer product links, they need to manually upload images of the products, take screenshots, or even edit video clips from those images and then share them. This results in a loss of time and effort. Normally, the main reason for this is the lack of features in social networks like Instagram to regulate link sharing, which is primarily intended for sharing photos and videos without the ability to share links. 

• Followers (potential customers) face problems accessing the links shared by influencers (follower-influencer relationship).
In order to always be aware of the products shared by the influencer, the follower must pay attention to the shares on the influencer's social media account. If they miss the shared links, they are forced to write a direct message this time. Such questions often remain unanswered, as it is physically impossible for an influencer with thousands of followers to respond to each message.

• The problem influencer faces in selecting the right product to share with the followers (influencer-product owner relationship).
The abundance of networks, the availability of more than 11000 affiliate programs in the United States alone (a quarter of these are locally placed on the owners' websites) mean that there are enough different sources to choose from for selecting products. Influencers usually do not want to make random product selections. Surveys show that 35% of them share products based on their own experience and interest area. They also prefer products that match the content shared on their social network accounts. 25% of influencers consider commission when choosing a product. The abundance and diversity of sources make the selection process and comparison difficult. Influencers end up having to follow and monitor hundreds of sites and sources in order to stay informed about the programs and innovations in place (which is not easy). 

• The relationship between influencers and product owners is limited to links (product owner-influencer relationship).
Usually, the relationship between the influencer and the product owner is either weak or nonexistent. The entire process is managed through links and that is it. Furthermore, the whole process focuses on the influencer finding the product they like and promoting it. For example, if a product owner likes a particular influencer and wants to work with them, or wants to attract influencers who share content related to the product they sell to their affiliate program, there are no regulatory mechanisms in place. As I mentioned earlier, influencers work so that they can recommend the products they have experienced to their followers. In this case, the influencer is forced to spend money from their own pocket to buy and test the product before sharing. This generates additional costs for them.

• Most of the affiliate programs in the market are focused on selling ""products"" and the offering of ""services"" is not sufficiently represented (product owner-influencer relationship).
When exploring the market, we see that products take precedence in affiliate programs. Fields of services such as psychologist consultations, beauty salon services, and the like have a lower share. The main reason for this is the scarcity of platforms where these services can be offered, which Fallin.link aims to tackle in the future. 

• Requirements and low commission rates when applying to affiliate programs of e-commerce platforms (e-commerce-influencer relationship).
We can point out the nuances that influencers face when applying to the prestigious affiliate programs of e-commerce sites. Requirements such as having a website and having a certain number of followers are demanded. Sometimes the approval process takes weeks. Despite the fact that the biggest share of these prestigious programs is held by these e-commerce programs, even the lowest commission fees are attributed to these programs. Depending on the product, this varies between 1-15%.

 //// Features to be implemented on the platform for addressing these problems ////

First of all, it is worth noting that the Fallin.link platform plans to consolidate all affiliate products obtained from various channels - (1.e-commerce affiliate programs, 2. Local affiliate programs offered by various stores on their online websites, 3. Networks to partner with) under one roof. 

*If any product owner does not offer an affiliate program either through the network we will partner with or on their own website but wants to increase their sales through the affiliate marketing method by adding the product to our platform, they can benefit from this process by adding the product they want to sell and the commission they have specified to the system by using the platform's internal network function. In essence, this function will be implemented for the Azerbaijani market. All affiliate products, images, information, and commission rates from all channels will be consolidated in the platform's database.

After that, when an influencer registers on the platform, we will help them create their own portfolio (think of this as the influencer's own store, where all the affiliate products they offer are gathered in one place). Here, with the condition that the links remain in the background, images of more products and information about the products will be highlighted. After the influencer creates a portfolio, by simply clicking on any product from the channels added to our database, they can add it to their portfolio. With integration, this process will automatically take place without any manual effort or loss of time.

If the influencer wishes, they can share their portfolio in various social network accounts without wasting time. Conditions will be provided for them to make more attractive shares with various templates for conducting such advertising campaigns. 

At the same time, the influencer can place a link to their portfolio in the bio of their social network account for once. By doing so, followers can always access their portfolio by transitioning to one link (portfolio), where they can see all the products shared together. As a result, instead of repeatedly sharing different or the same links, transitioning to one link (portfolio) will ensure accessibility to all shared products. Also, through the notification system, followers will always be informed about new products added to the influencer's portfolio. This will eliminate the problem faced by followers.

The platform will streamline the influencer's product selection process. Products entered into the platform's database will be categorized under specific and suitable categories. As a result, by using filters, the influencer can compare and select the right product for themselves without going through the challenge of individually searching through hundreds of sources. In general, it will be possible to analyze products that will be the trend in affiliate marketing for that period using this platform.

Additionally, the internal feedback functionality is planned to be implemented on the platform. This will allow the influencer to consider both the opinion of their followers when selecting products and choose products in line with the general interests of the audience. Correct product selection will enable the influencer to meet the needs of their followers, thus increasing their sales and ultimately their commission income.

The platform also aims to strengthen the relationship between the product owner and the influencer. If a product owner likes a particular influencer, especially if they want to work with them or generally attract influencers who share content related to their product on social media, they can find and invite them to join the affiliate program. To incentivize, when sending an offer, they can offer a higher commission rate than the set one in the database or send a demo product. If an influencer wants to try a product, instead of spending from their own pocket to purchase it, they can request a demo product from the product owner through the platform. It will also be possible to send a survey to the product owner to reconsider the commission rate.

As mentioned as another problem, we pointed out the requirements when applying to e-commerce sites' affiliate programs. In the future, when collaboration takes place (e.g. with Trendyol), the vendor selling the product can voluntarily join our platform and add any products they sell to our database. In that case, if the product owner sets a 20% commission, our platform can distribute 15% to the influencer, split 5% for a 3% cashback to the customer, and 2% as the platform's own revenue.","[{""label"":""Competo (Umico)"",""id"":""7""},{""label"":""PASHA Malls"",""id"":""12""},{""label"":""Pasha Holding"",""id"":""1""},{""label"":""Bravo"",""id"":""9""}]","There is a gap in applying Affiliate Marketing in the local market, even though Trendyol has established this tradition.

In the foreign market, however, we can consider link-in-bio type platforms as competitors. Because they are intended for sharing links and can be used for sharing affiliate links. However, any platform in the market that focuses on features and problem-solving, as Fallin.link does, is not currently available. Only the link-in-bio type of other platforms have the chance to implement these innovations in the future. 

Also, because platforms like Wordpress and similar website creation portals can act as competitors, as everyone can build their own portfolio (website) as I mentioned. However, this would be an absurd idea. Because it is not logical for any female influencer to build their website from such portals and wait for plugins to work. The main issue here is the automation of processes and their presentation. Influencers need a simple and easy way to quickly add products and share them with their followers, just like they would share a post on Instagram.",

I wanted to present the ""Take Charge"" project to you. As we know, worldwide, prominent car manufacturers are increasing the production of electric motor vehicles by reducing internal combustion engine production. Just like in many countries, electric motor vehicles are increasing in Azerbaijan as well. In the months of January-March of this year, of the 3,047 (valued at 66.198 million US dollars) transportation vehicles alongside the internal combustion engine, 408 (valued at 16.97 million US dollars) are solely powered by electric motors. This means a decrease of 2.96% for the former and an increase of 5.8 times for the latter. However, the number of energy filling stations is already insufficient nationwide. At present, no charging cable is provided when purchasing the currently produced 'electric vehicles' for safety reasons. Consumers are obligated to procure their own charging devices and cables. The European Union has also adopted a decision that diesel, gasoline, and other engine vehicles will not be produced in Europe by the year 2035. This means that after 12 years, everyone in Europe will drive electric cars. Azerbaijan is part of Europe and the world. The proposed business idea for our Republic involves not only the import and sale of mobile energy charging stations for personal use but also the import of energy charging devices for general use and their installation in various locations. Revenue will be generated both from the sale of mobile stations and from the use of the installed stations. Electric vehicles should not be limited to driving only in Baku; we should be able to go anywhere with them. This requires creating conditions. It is necessary for all hotels and restaurants to create electric vehicle charging stations. This means that when customers arrive with electric vehicles, they should not have to park on the streets. Furthermore, recreational centers and other facilities should also provide this.",,,,,S73bUTYIjy,,,,,,,,#businessoffuture,,

Such as transferring to another platform with deductions for fees at the beginning, as well as when transferring and converting crypto to dollars or another currency with deductions for fees as well, and then deductions for transferring to a bank account in Azerbaijan. Losses can range from 3-9% and higher with all transfers until the end. Therefore, considering that if they invest in their own country's cryptocurrency exchange, the fees percentages will be minimal. They can range from 0.1 to 0.5% max and based on the business model, they will be lower at the beginning. 5) If clients engage in trading on the Azerbaijani exchange, this model entails slightly higher fees than from holding and acquiring cryptocurrencies. Overall, the plan is that even with trading, the fees for citizens of the country will be lower at the beginning and for several years than for other cryptocurrencies. 6) When creating a cryptocurrency exchange with all security measures in mind, create a separate storage bank with its own servers. Create a storage bank for at least 30 major cryptocurrencies and directly sell them at market price to the exchange's clients. 7) After implementing the cryptocurrency exchange, the opportunity to integrate with key banks in Azerbaijan in accordance with the law. That is, banks such as Kapital bank and Pasha Bank will offer their platform for users to buy cryptocurrencies, which will turn users into holders and depending on the exchange rate of the acquired cryptocurrency, they can exchange it for dollars or another currency (Manat or Euro). 7) Deposit investments, staking (floating rate or fixed, as well as auto-investing) will only be possible on the exchange in Azerbaijan. 8) Creating its own cryptocurrency exchange in Azerbaijan in compliance with the law will ensure the country does not lose money and funds are not transferred to other exchanges, and provide control over the commission and profits received to the founder's company and the country's budget. 9) Having a cryptocurrency exchange in the country will contribute to the development of the market and the country's interests on the global stage. 10) Considering long-term perspectives, the Azerbaijani cryptocurrency exchange will be open to investors from other countries, offering an opportunity to earn additional profit with a favorable offer for foreign exchange users. Key advantages of our Khazinance exchange: Key security and reliability are the fundamental principles of creating a cryptocurrency exchange in Azerbaijan. Protecting user data and assets. To achieve this, the cryptocurrency exchange must use modern encryption methods and mandatory multifactor authentication. 1) Verification (Security) 2) Installing Google Authenticator 3) Integration with Asan Xidmet (Users' passport data) 4) SMS notification upon registration and cooperation with all providers in the country 5) Using user biometry protection protocols 6) Minimal fees for withdrawals and conversions to other currencies, as well as initially, P2P transfers without fees 7) Minimal fees for traders 8) Customer support: Establishing a support service where clients can receive assistance on any issues related to using the exchange. This can be implemented through online chat, email, or phone. 9) User training: Conducting regular educational webinars to help new clients understand how to use the exchange, how to protect their accounts, etc. 10) User guides: Developing user guides that can help clients understand the exchange's features and how to correctly use its functions. 11) Analytical support: Providing analytical support, including news and analytical reports on the cryptocurrency market that can help clients make more informed decisions about their investments. 12) Ability for fast fund withdrawals to bank accounts",,,,,KpESYWLw4B,,,,,,,,Platform for trading and cryptocurrencies,,

Insurance is a very conventional sector that is slow to innovate and adapt novice solutions. Their business model is not customer-friendly at its core with the aim to collect as much premiums as possible and give as less as possible on claims.
Therefore, local clients face several challenges:A lack of trust in insurance companies, leading to skepticism about the claim process and payout fairness, which overall results in low penetration (The insurance penetration rate for 2022 is 0.7%);Many potential clients are not using insurance products due to their religious beliefs, which conflict with conventional insurance offerings. A survey commissioned by KOBIA revealed that many clients refrain from banking/insurance products due to religious views. Therefore, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan aims to develop Islamic finance tools by 2026;Certain client segments are left with no access to insurance services since they are deemed unattractive to traditional insurers. Taxi drivers, couriers, motorcyclists, and others are among such clientele.
Solution:Introducing Ijma: Reimagining Insurance through Community Empowerment.At Ijma, we recognize these challenges and aim to address them with a new era of collaborative protection. As we believe in the strength of the community, our innovative approach redefines insurance by putting the power into the hands of users. We enable individuals to come together, form a collective monetary pool to cover potential losses, and collectively manage claims and funds. With Ijma, clients are not just policyholders; they’re essential members of a dynamic and caring community.

Unique Segments, Unique Solutions:We target three distinct segments, each with its own compelling reasons to choose us:Values-Driven: Our community-based approach ensures that decisions on claims and payments are made collectively with the principles of the majority votes. With Ijma, clients can find insurance that mirrors their values without compromising their convictions;Underserved: a taxi driver, motorcyclist, or courier - our platform welcomes everyone. By forming their community, clients gain access to insurance, closing the gap left by traditional insurers;Price-Sensitive: We don’t hold premium payments at the end of the term and distribute the remaining funds proportionally to contributions. Moreover, since Ijma is a startup that utilizes automation and community management, there're not much overheads, so clients receive more competitive rates. Expanding Horizons:Our vision extends beyond the horizon of the insurance industry. As we grow, we plan to diversify into sectors such as P2P Financing and Crowdfunding, amplifying the spirit of collective support. We anticipate not just the game-changing launch in Azerbaijan, but the global expansion with the countries such as Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and others in the spotlight. Moreover, the concept can be expanded into the Blockchain by forming DAO and managing processes with smart contracts.

Relevance for the Group:Ijma will not just provide a new revenue stream and global presence for PASHA Holding, but it will benefit the Group in terms of ecosystem initiatives by expanding the client base, activating community engagement, and enriching consumer data through integrations with Birbank or M10.

I truly believe that this startup can revolutionize the insurance sector by providing accessibility and transparency for hundreds of thousands of clients. And a subtle thought that I can make a difference and bring value to the community inspires me!So, join us and experience the future as Ijma is reimagining insurance!",,,,,6F9p3gYEDW,,,,,,,,Reimagining Insurance through Community Empowerment,,

We are delighted to present to you the innovative virtual lottery platform where dreams come true! We intend to create an exciting opportunity to offer incredible gifts to participants at less than 1% of the retail value. Today, we want to talk about the platform where we can offer everyone exciting and completely transparent virtual lottery games that match their interests and keep them engaged. 
· How Virtual Lottery Works:
On the platform, a wide range of desirable items such as household appliances, transportation vehicles, digital devices, and more can be played as a jackpot prize. Each prize has an assigned retail value, a predetermined number of tickets available for purchase, and participants can buy lottery tickets at a nominal cost for a chance to win the prize. For example, if the selling price of the prize is 1,000.00 manat and the price of each ticket is 2 manat, the lottery is scheduled to take place on the third business day after the sale of the 500th ticket. Participants can increase their chances by purchasing several tickets. Of course, each user will have personal cabinets on the platform where they can store necessary information. Each ticket will have a unique code and can be purchased online or through special payment terminals. Detailed information about the ticket will be visible in the participant's personal cabinet on the platform and will be sent to their email address. Lottery sales will be announced from the day a game starts and the end date of the sales will be noted. If all tickets are sold before the end date, the game will begin within the next 3 business days, with a general notification sent to participants and users. If tickets are not fully sold by the end date of the extension, the game will be canceled, and the value of the purchased tickets will be refunded to the participants' accounts, creating conditions for them to use the funds for other games. The uniqueness of this lottery is that there will always be a winner for each game. Participants will not receive any information that no winner was selected in a game. 
· Advantages of Participation
Joining the virtual lottery platform brings several interesting advantages:
- Favorable chances of winning high-value items at a minimal cost compared to retail prices;
- Exciting and engaging experience for all participants;
- Transparency and fairness in the lottery process, providing equal opportunities for all;
- Convenient online access, allowing participation anytime, anywhere through mobile applications and the web;
- Opportunity to connect with lottery enthusiasts in a live setting. 
· Transparency and Fairness
We embrace transparency and fairness in the lottery process and will do our best to make participants feel confident. After the minimum number of tickets is sold, a random selection will be conducted using a secure and certified system. The winner will be selected transparently and fairly, with everyone having an equal chance of winning. We aim to use advanced technology to ensure the integrity and reliability of the lottery system. Live broadcasts on the platform and physical draws with the participation of a state institution representative on specified days and times per week are planned to ensure system integrity and reliability. 
· Winner Selection and Prize Delivery
The winner of each lottery will be announced on the platform with the participant number and the first initials of their name and surname. This ensures transparency in revealing the winner and protects their privacy. We will notify the lucky individuals and organize the delivery of their prizes. The prize will be presented at an office or another location with the participation of representatives from the office or relevant institution. Rest assured, as a team, we will ensure that all prizes are safely and timely delivered to the winners as soon as they are identified (within 30 business days in compliance with regulations). We look forward to delighting our lucky participants and anticipating the joy of receiving the desired items! 
· Security and Privacy
We understand the importance of security and privacy in online transactions. Strong and modern security measures will be implemented to protect the personal and financial information of participants on the platform. We will ensure the utmost caution and confidentiality in managing sensitive information and adhere to the rules of protecting critical data. 
· Target Audience

It is no secret that they actively seek opportunities to participate in lotteries regularly and enhance their chances of winning. 
Deal Hunters: People always on the lookout for great deals and discounts will find our platform enticing. The opportunity to win high-value items at a fraction of the retail price appeals to bargain hunters seeking value for their money.

· Project Overview
The cost of developing and launching the virtual lottery platform will vary depending on various factors, including the platform's complexity, features, design, scale, and the chosen development approach. It is important to consider the following potential cost components: 
Development: This includes the recruitment of a development team or partnership with a development agency to build the platform. The cost will depend on the scope of work, required features, and hourly rates maintained by the development team or project-based payments. 
Platform Design: The design of an intuitive and visually appealing platform may require the services of professional designers. The cost will vary based on the complexity of design elements, the number of screens, and the experience of hired designers. 
Infrastructure and Hosting: Investing in reliable and scalable infrastructure for hosting and maintaining the platform is essential. The cost will fluctuate based on server requirements, storage needs, and anticipated traffic volume. 
Payment Processing: Integrating secure and efficient payment processing mechanisms is crucial for managing ticket sales and operations. Depending on the chosen payment methods, installation fees, transaction fees, and ongoing processing costs may be incurred. 
Security and Compliance: Lottery platforms must prioritize security measures and compliance to protect user information and adhere to regulations. Investing in security audits, encryption technologies, and compliance with relevant legal requirements will incur additional costs. 
Marketing and Promotion: Allocating a budget for marketing and promotional activities is crucial to attract participants to our platform. This may include online advertising, social media campaigns, influential partnerships, and other marketing strategies. 
Operational Costs: Maintenance costs such as customer support, technical service for servers, software updates, and platform enhancements should be taken into account. These costs will ensure the smooth operation and continuous improvement of our online lottery platform. 
Providing precise figures for specific project details can be challenging until the special project details have been finalized. However, the development and launch of an online lottery platform can cost anywhere from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of manat depending on the factors mentioned above. 
· Revenue Generation
Ticket Sales: The primary source of revenue for our platform will be the sale of lottery tickets. Participants will purchase tickets at a set price, and each ticket sale will generate income for our platform. Considering cost-effective retention for participants, we plan to strategically set ticket prices. 
Operation Fees: Operational fees can be included for each ticket purchase. For example, a small commission or flat fee may be charged for every sale on the platform. This fee can contribute additional revenue while covering the costs associated with payment processing and platform maintenance. 
Advertising and Partnerships: As our online lottery platform grows, we can explore advertising opportunities and partnerships with relevant brands. Companies interested in reaching our platform's audience may pay for advertising space or engage in promotional activities with us. This additional revenue stream can create extra income for our platform. 
Premium Features: We plan to offer premium features or subscription plans to enhance user experience and provide additional value to participants. Premium features may include benefits such as early access to lottery listings, exclusive promotions, or increased chances of winning. Participants opting for these features or plans will contribute revenue through regular payments. 
Sponsorship: Partnering with sponsors interested in promoting their products or services to our platform's audience can create another revenue stream. Sponsors can offer rewards, contribute to the prize fund, or provide financial support in exchange for brand exposure. 
· EcoSystem
We believe that the establishment of this project could also provide special benefits to the development of many businesses. For example, ticket purchases for participation in virtual games could be made by payment terminals, which could also mean an additional financial source for these companies, or when banks process these payments with credit cards, along with providing financial benefits to banks, it can also support the provision of cashless payments in the country. In addition, various types of gift vouchers determined for additional lottery games will be tailored to suit each participant's needs. For example, travel packages, home goods, personal care items, electronic devices, transportation vehicles, and more may be offered as prizes. Imagine that each prize played in a lottery will contribute to a store's or business's sales or service support.
Moreover, when participants use their Umico Bonuses earned during shopping at Bravo Supermarkets or when using Uklon taxi service to purchase lottery tickets, ensuring that participants actively use these bonuses will guarantee their active participation in the lottery. This will provide an opportunity for participants to join the lottery without any additional payment. We also want to mention that making payments for tickets directly to the accounts in personal cabinets or through M10 will ensure safe and prompt transactions, contributing to the provision of another part of the EcoSystem very safely and promptly. Of course, this list can be expanded further. 
Specifically, we would like to emphasize that the success development of this project with the expected results in a short period will greatly benefit from the support of other companies belonging to the PAŞA Holding group, in addition to PAŞA Holding leading the group. 
· Thank you!
We appreciate the time and attention you have given today. We hope that we have succeeded in arousing some degree of trust and interest in this project. In any case, we believe that this project will be valued by PAŞA Holding, which is a significant benefactor to the country's business sector. We eagerly await welcoming you to our virtual lottery platform and sharing the excitement of winning various desired gifts with you!

We can classify the purposes of readers into several categories: shaping worldviews, personal development, education, work, etc. Each category of readers faces several problems: high prices of education and personal development books, lack of systems for renting books, delays in finding technical books, etc. These problems will be eliminated with the HomeLib application. With the HomeLib application, users can rent out or sell books they do not use or no longer need, rent or buy books from other users, and also buy books online from bookstores on the platform. Users can earn money by putting their books up for sale and can also be convenient for other users.HomeLib aims to provide a wide variety of books by offering books in different categories. This will help users discover books that meet their preferences. Users will be able to easily search for books, carry out rental or purchase processes.Additionally, HomeLib will allow users to leave reviews and ratings during the process. This will help other users make more informed book selections.In addition, it aims to create a social network among book lovers. Users can discuss books, make recommendations, and stay in touch with each other. How Does the Process Work?1. User creates an account on the HomeLib application.2. User records information about the books they can rent or sell (Book Name, Author, Language, Book Condition, Price, etc.) in their account.3. Another user searches for the book they need in the database and rents or buys that book. 4. Obtaining books from HomeLib points in the city.Revenue Models:Users - Getting a commission for each book rental, sale, purchase process.Partnerships - Joint activities with companies involved in book sales. Commission from books sold through the platform. Advertising - Generating revenue from advertisements placed on the platform. Creating the HomeLib Brand - Sales of various souvenirs, t-shirts, book accessories. Renting out other portable items - such as cameras, etc.Our Goals:Reaching the local audience. HomeLib aims to reach a large portion of the book-reading community (Students, Workers, and other book readers). Collaboration with publishing houses. (Qanun, Libraff, etc.)Introducing the platform to the international market. Opening branches in neighboring countries in the first strategic period (Georgia, Turkey). In the second strategic period, opening several branches in Europe. Transforming the platform into a social network format. (Users spending a significant portion of their time on HomeLib, being scored based on the books they read, maintaining relationships and sharing with friends, writing blog posts.)

Healthy Family fitness center
The idea is to create a new service for families, where sports activities take place simultaneously at the same time with family members, which allows firstly to save time, secondly, to spend it successfully and beneficially with a child (other family members). 
In modern times, we all feel a lack of full-fledged communication. Especially affected are children, who, due to the busyness of parents, spend all their free time with gadgets. Lack of parental attention greatly affects the child, and this can affect their future. However, there is a wonderful opportunity to make contact - joint workouts. And as a bonus, you will get strong health!
Joint family workouts can be presented in the following formats: -mom + child, -dad + child, -whole family, -separately parent and child, each in their own section but at the same time and others. Main types of services: • attend classes for children and adults in all fitness club halls (gym, crossfit room, etc.);• pool;• learn at the martial arts school and test your skills in the professional ring;• relax and rejuvenate in the spa area,• engage in sports at any convenient time suitable for all family members and so on.
Joint or parallel sports activities in the sports club will help to find a common language with your child even in the difficult teenage period. Sport gives the opportunity to participate in the upbringing of one's children. During joint workouts, parents teach their children to be hardworking, determined.

With the app, people can conveniently order food and make reservations for places they'd like to visit. They can view pictures of these places too.

Additionally, we'll offer analytical services for companies.For example, we'll provide restaurant recommendations tailored to their searches and interests for special occasions or leisure days. A notable advantage we offer is that if someone frequently orders the same food from the same place, they'll receive a discount. Also, people can choose a category to check prices they're interested in.

In the future, the platform will reflect reviews of each institution from parents' perspective. Reviews will be written as text, as well as a rating system for different categories (food, development, staff, facilities, etc). Thus, in the future, each institution will have its own rating, which will be composed of different factors. Also, during the search, a rating system for different factors can be used to choose a kindergarten.

In the era where ecological risks have reached their peak, there is an increasing trend towards eco-life in our country. For example, the expansion of environmental protection associations' activities, efficient use of resources through recycling, and the replacement of internal combustion engine vehicles over time with electrically powered vehicles can serve as examples. At a time when there is interest in electric cars in our country, the lack of charging stations for these cars or their failure to meet the demand are considered major gaps. Therefore, when it comes to buying this type of car, buyers are hesitant because most of the population lives in multi-storey residential buildings where establishing infrastructure is either not possible or obtaining permits is difficult. As a result, people turn to charging stations, which slows down the process due to the reasons mentioned above. In foreign experience, there are electric charging stations that resemble today's petrol stations, where people can quickly charge their cars and additionally spend money at a coffee shop/market type place located there (this can be evaluated as cross income). The application of this experience in the Azerbaijani market would be appropriate, where mass charging stations can be formed in city centers, especially in market parking lots (especially in Bravo hypermarkets and superstores). For example, currently there are a limited number of fuel stations and charging points in special parking areas, which are constantly in use; another factor is that the devices are not supported by all types of electric cars. To seize the market gap and the opportunity to be the first in this business, I propose the creation of a ""PASHA Charging Center.""",,,,,HWoMQkMN2b,,,,,,,,Charging stations for electric vehicles,,

However, what makes us different is that we do this job years and we got two more things - an already built community and a significant startup background. 
Up to date, we have built a second hand sellers and buyers community that completed 10000+ sales through our Telegram group or Instagram pages. We also sell ourselves and hold the most amount of second hand sales in the country, even managed to open our physical shop. However, the community we have built is self-managed and members are free to post and sell their goods without any compensation. After all those years we decided to digitalize this system and create an app where we can benefit from all those sales (as currently we don’t get any percentage when people sell through our Telegram groups).
So literally, we lack an app in the local market to bring together those sellers and buyers and benefit from it as creators.
Our team already developed a GTM plan and Farid the founder from PASHA Bank has worked with startups since the start of his career - either founding his own startup or working in a startup studios from Singapore to UK.
We also thought of working with Umico as a part of potential Umico Garderobe or Umico Shkaff. There is a potential for partnership as well. 
We have a pre-liminary data which indicates that our target market in Azerbaijan currently circulates 10M AZN of sales in a year through people selling their pre-owned clothes. Our first aim is to capture 8-10% of it at in the first phase. For the second phase plan is to increase more awareness in the market, hit 2M AZN of revenue by the end of the year 2 and get to the next market.
Turgut from our team has done this job for years in Ukraine and Georgia. We also have strong contacts in those markets and for expansion those countrise will definitely be in our plan.
There are many apparel marketplace startups in Azerbaijan. They usually lack experience, community of sellers or market knowledge. Our team has been in this market for 3 to 5 years and Farid, the founder has helped 10+ startups build their products where they received over 3M USD of investment. We also have 3000+ sellers in our community which we can onboard at least 30% at the launch period.

I note that initially planned as an MVP (minimum viable product) and later expanded to other locations, it proposes scaling through partnerships with government and private companies.

Initially, I would like to highlight some benefits of installing energy refueling stations for electric vehicles in supermarket areas:

Convenience: Electric vehicle stations in supermarket areas provide a convenient location for electric vehicle owners to recharge while shopping, saving time and effort from making a separate trip to a charging station.

Increased Traffic: Supermarkets are frequently visited by large numbers of people, offering electric vehicle owners the opportunity to attract potential customers to the supermarket while refueling their vehicles. This could lead to increased sales at the store and potential future sales.

Extended Dwell Time: Charging an electric car typically takes some time. By providing energy refueling stations, supermarkets can encourage electric vehicle owners to spend more time in their stores waiting for their vehicles to charge, potentially resulting in increased sales as customers have more time to explore the store's offerings.

Customer Loyalty: Supermarkets offering electric vehicle charging facilities demonstrate commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility, fostering customer loyalty among environmentally conscious individuals who prioritize supporting businesses aligned with their values.

Positive Brand Image: Supporting electric mobility and offering energy refueling infrastructure can position supermarkets as forward-thinking and environmentally friendly establishments. This can attract environmentally conscious customers and enhance the overall perception of the supermarket in the community.

Partnership Opportunities: Supermarkets can explore partnerships with electric vehicle manufacturers or energy refueling network operators to establish charging stations. Such partnerships can bring mutual benefits through marketing opportunities, customer attraction, and shared revenue.

Government Incentives: In some regions, governments incentivize businesses to install electric vehicle charging stations. By reducing associated costs through the implementation of charging infrastructure, supermarkets can take advantage of these incentives. Overall, having electric vehicle stations in supermarket areas can create a win-win situation benefiting both electric vehicle owners and supermarkets, promoting sustainability, attracting customers, and enhancing the overall shopping experience.

The benefits mentioned above are just a fraction of the advantages.",,,,,vTpCXanBZv,,,,,,,,Energy refueling stations at Bravo supermarkets,,

""OneClick"" will visually and informatively present these to customers. Therefore, when a customer wants to use any financial tool, whether it's instant money transfers, card-to-card transactions, cashback, deposits, insurance products, or even cash loans, by simply entering desired values, they can quickly and easily compare bank products. Advantages of the ""OneClick"" project: 1. Benefit from the most convenient rates with one click; 2. Save money; 3. Be informed about existing financial products; 4. Benefit from the product that gives the most cashback at stores and dining establishments; 5. Stay informed about the offers provided by financial entities; 6. Quickly and easily achieve your goals; Currently, the lack of such a tool in the market leads people to search for products for a long time and remain uninformed about where and how they can benefit from offers. This results in little utilization of products provided by banks and other financial entities and incurs additional costs for the product to come into market. Some of the most common issues we face are: ""If we transfer from one card to another, how much will the service fee be?"", ""Where and with which card can I get more cashback for this product?"", ""Which card can provide longer installments and lower interest rates if I buy this product from there?"", ""Which miles card is the most beneficial?"" The ""OneClick"" project is here to help you get rid of these and similar questions in the shortest possible time. Initially, the project will be presented to both IOS and Android users through an app with the most user-friendly interface.

This online platform offers unique content by including collaborations, events and news, service packages, and social projects within the holding, showcasing all the variety and opportunities offered to the holding's own employees, customers, and partners.

The main objective is to create a unique digital platform/channel within the holding that contributes to the growth and development of all companies within the holding. In addition, it aims to increase awareness of the holding's products and services and support internal initiatives. It strengthens internal relationships, promotes products and services, as well as supports social projects.

Challenges include:
• Creating coordination in social and corporate initiatives: Supports joint operations of all companies within the holding, bringing companies together in the holding around common ideas and goals, allowing them to emphasize shared values and principles.
• Lack of a unified digital internet channel internally: Enables collaborations, sponsorships, products, and successes to be tracked from a single platform within the holding, allowing for strengthening relationships between companies.
• Strengthening internal communication: Ensures effective mutual communication and exchange of news and information between companies within the holding, helping shape corporate culture.
• Challenges in internal innovation and marketing efforts: Establishes a platform for companies to showcase their products, services, and achievements, improving the overall understanding of the holding, enhancing their effectiveness and visibility. It enables the alignment of advertising and marketing campaigns, providing a more coordinated and effective approach for promoting the holding's products and services.","I am the creator of azens.az, the First Encyclopedic Platform of the Azerbaijan Republic.

The majority of cars on the roads are capable of exceeding speeds of 150-200 km/h, which in turn encourages drivers to experience the adrenaline rush. Despite penalties and other regulatory measures, the number of accidents due to speeding continues to rise annually. To prevent such incidents, many countries have the necessary infrastructure (race tracks) for driving at high speeds. Unfortunately, Azerbaijan lacks such conditions, leading many drivers to exceed speed limits on public roads, resulting in numerous accidents (some fatal). To address these types of accidents, we propose the organization of 'drag race' events in the Azerbaijani territory. Within this project, speed enthusiasts will have the opportunity to race against other cars not on public roads but on designated territory. This practice is widely used in other countries (USA (NHRA), Russia (Unlim 500+), UAE (Dubai Drag Racing), etc.). Within the project framework, for holding races, an appropriate 1 km long asphalt-covered area must be selected (402-meter racing zone length, with the remaining area designated for braking and the starting section). For example, the area of the Badamdar car market and the area of the Riyadh Trade Center could be initially considered. Once the area is selected, safety measures such as the installation of appropriate protective barriers along the length of the road, cleaning of the asphalt cover, spectator seating, technical inspection area for participating cars, emergency medical services, protective helmets for participating drivers, police services, and fire services must be taken into account. Furthermore, the initial process of notifying about the race will be initiated, and drivers willing to participate must apply by submitting the respective online form. The applications of the drivers will be evaluated by the project's technical team based on the relevant criteria, and their participation in the race will be approved. Drivers who meet the requirements will be required to sign the corresponding consent forms and pay the participation fee before their participation is confirmed. It should be noted that drivers will be held responsible for any unfortunate incidents that may occur before the race, and they will be required to sign a document accepting liability for any damage to other properties in case of an accident. Participants approved for the race and the list of cars will be analyzed by the technical team and divided into 3 categories based on horsepower:100 - 200 horsepower vehicles200 - 300 horsepower vehicles300 horsepower and aboveIn addition, the participation of cars in the race will be considered based on whether they have 4x4 traction and rear/front traction. Video recordings will be made for the draw during the race, and GoPro-type cameras will be installed both inside and outside the cars participating in the race. The race track will be 402 meters long (1/4 mile) and the outcome of the race will be announced through a microphone. Before the race, the promotion of the event through paid advertising on social networks and the attraction of famous bloggers will be considered. The video footage of the race will be shared on the AvtoMeydan YouTube channel (this channel is designated for this project and other similar projects in the future) and other platforms. Considering the high interest in automobiles in Azerbaijan, it is anticipated that there will be sufficient participants and spectators for the event.",,,,,vtj51OeeMU,,,,,,,,"Car racing, Drag race, Automobile event",,

As a customer-oriented person with an interest in the automotive environment, I came up with this idea. In the current situation, a person who wants to buy a car goes to the car market. However, in the market, due to the chaotic arrangement of cars, the customer has a hard time finding the desired car among thousands of cars based on their preferred color, brand, and other specifications. I think the solution to this problem is to create an application specific to a new car market. The first step in the market is to equip parking spaces for cars, assign numbers, and equip the barriers with a smart system so that when the customer sees the car's number, it automatically opens. It will be very easy to fill out the application. Required information: Car brand and model, License Plate Number, and color. After registration is completed, payment is made with M10, the seller receives a QR code or receipt, and the location number in the market. As there is more demand for entry into the market, the price can be determined differently. The seller already secures a spot for their car while sitting at home. When entering the market, as the seller approaches the barrier, the barrier opens thanks to the integrated information, and the seller finds and keeps their spot in the registered number. The customer no longer has difficulty finding the desired car brand and model. Both the customer and the seller are happy. This will support us in terms of data for our group companies to benefit from (such as M10, Kapital Bank, Competo, PASHA Insurance - offering comprehensive insurance for sold cars).","Innovation lies in the fact that for the first time, physically transitioning the market to digital and allowing the customer to both reserve a place digitally and easily find the desired car.","{""label"":""Yes, I do confirm"",""id"":1}",,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rizvan-mammadov-050371130/,,"By eliminating the problem people face in the car market, we gain satisfaction as a customer-oriented person and also earn income by becoming the CEO of my own idea.","{""label"":""Yes"",""id"":1}",,,"Facilitates car selection

The content of the program is extensive, but I will try to explain it in the shortest form.
With this product, Kapital Bank will motivate people who love sport and entertainment.
In the country, the number of people who are interested in sports games is quite large.
Currently, people who want to play sport games have difficulty finding a playground, and payments are made in retail, cash. The players have difficulty in communicating with each other, with the fields, and finding the address. In order to facilitate the process and motivate users, Kapital Bank can present this product to customers with a mobile application. To make the games played more interesting, to create communication between people interested in games in the country, to facilitate shopping at Kapital Bank's partner stores, to easily find playgrounds, book time and place, to form teams with strangers, in order for them to be able to monitor and improve their statistics, a mobile application is being written where they can make payments only with Kapital Bank's means of payment (physical and virtual cards). Users will play more games to raise their own and team statistics.
Users' statistics will give them a chance to get invited to stronger teams.
For example: Tural wants to play basketball, but he is having trouble gathering a team. For this, he enters the application, selects the category Basketball, and follows the ratings of people interested in basketball. By choosing the players in the required position and rating for the team, Buddy will send a request, when the other party approves, they will contact, and they will talk, agree and build a team through the chat in the application. The team plays games, and as a result, the rankings of both that team and the players are formed. If Tural gets a 9/10 rating, he will be on the top list in his category, and those who are looking for a player for the team will invite Tural to a strong team. In this way, competition will be created, and players who will get a discount based on their rating, will play a lot of games and compete in order to raise their rating.
Users who get good statistics can get Cashback and discount at partner stores in the App. With this, both the Bank can offer its products to customers more easily, and the turnover will increase to some extent. The mobile application, which belongs only to Kapital Bank, can both contribute to the Bank and provide users with more interesting, easy, competitive, and richly winning entertainment. The project does not exist in any Bank globally. It is currently being written by me, and may be released soon if supported..","I'm sure other participants have interesting ideas, but I've worked hard on my project, and I think it's functional enough, profitable, interesting for people who like to do sports and have fun.","[{""id"":""1"",""label"":""Yes, I do confirm""}]",,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/?trk=homepage-basic_sign-in-submit,,"I have been actively involved in sport games for 10 years now, and my understanding and connections in this field are quite good.

It all began when I found myself in a situation, desperately wanting to attend the Eyyub Yagubov’s concert. I searched on the internet and social medias Facebook and Instagram maybe someone sells and applied several tags even called my surrounding maybe I can find. It was very time-consuming, unfortunately I could not find. It struck me that this issue extended beyond just concert tickets; travelers, too, often face the dilemma of canceling or altering their flights and hotel bookings, museum tickets due to unforeseen circumstances.
So, I came up with Biglet, a special website. Here's how it works: Let's say you bought a ticket to a concert, a flight, or a hotel room. But then things change, and you can't go anymore. Instead of losing your money, you can sell your ticket or booking on Biglet. And guess what? You can sell it for less than the usual price, so you don't lose too much money.
Now, on the other side, there are people who want to go to concerts or take trips but don't want to pay the full price. They come to Biglet and find tickets and bookings that others are selling for less. So, they get to do fun stuff without spending too much.
But Biglet is more than just buying and selling. It's a friendly place where people can help each other out. You can read what others think about a seller or a buyer before making a deal. This way, everyone knows they can trust each other.
Did you know that a lot of people end up changing their plans? It happens more often than you think. Biglet is here for all those people. It helps those who need to change their plans sell what they can't use anymore. And it helps those who are looking for cool things to do get them at a good price.
I'm the one who came up with Biglet, and I'm so excited about it. It's super easy to use, and it's like a big community where everyone can win. So, let's make swapping plans and finding new adventures awesome together with Biglet!

Our project 'E-Course' will help you with that. It will facilitate the search for the right teacher/course, which will be gathered in our database.
	How will the 'E-Course' application work?
	The client wants to find a course. They enter the application and see all the possible offers. Then the client chooses the necessary course category (it is possible to connect all categories, from language learning or programming to culinary courses or sewing courses). If necessary, the client sets filters (by prices, class schedule, location), and a list of all available courses opens in front of them, among which the client can choose one that meets their conditions. At the same time, in the application, both courses and private tutors offer their services, thus expanding their client base.
	Why will clients use the application?
	Convenience and simplicity in finding a course.	The opportunity to evaluate and compare courses.	Various bonuses and discounts on courses, when registering through the application.
	Why will tutors use the application?
	The opportunity to expand their client base and recognition by receiving public and reliable feedback on their quality work.


 'E-Course' will allow you to:
Using filters, select the desired course category, their prices, location, and schedule. Use our statistics, which will be available openly and will help students make the final choice, and help tutors improve their performance based on figures. Rate and comment on the course taken. Access recommended educational materials in Azerbaijani and Russian languages. Upon completion of the course, receive a QR code (link) that can be used on your CV.

Subsequently, through the means of contracting with lawyers, we will ensure the participation of these lawyers on the platform.

The most important benefit of the project to Pasha Group will be mainly through reader participation with their personal choice in the survey section of the site, where we, and our partner companies (or any company within Pasha Group), can present the marketing-oriented ideas of the reader audience and customer psychology about any new product introduced to the market in exchange for the amount in the contract concluded between us. This will allow any company X to directly learn the consumer's opinions about the product it has created or introduced to the market, by paying us an X amount for market research, thus gaining the opportunity to precisely learn the customer's views. In addition, receiving information about discounts and/or campaign opportunities on the product to the email address or phone number of the customer by their choice in the survey will create additional value for both our readers and our partners. These surveys will also be useful for companies in the ""Customer experience"" and ""Customer development"" stages. Small boxes will be gifted by the company to every 2 out of 10 participants in the survey, creating additional enthusiasm in customers to participate in the survey. Another benefit we obtain from the project will be to create interesting and creative content about any product our customers want to introduce to the market on the site. For example, if any company X is engaged in the sale of BMW brand cars. We will inform the reader at the end of our article titled ""15 outstanding features of owning a BMW"" where the reader can buy this branded car more affordably. In addition, Google ADS and Adviad ADS type advertisements placed on the site will also be part of the site's additional revenues.

Traveling the same route, sometimes even working in the same building, some are unaware of each other as they come and go on the same road, some with their personal cars and some with public transportation. Those with personal cars are conscious of the cost of the journey while those who use public transportation are more in search of comfort. There is a mutual solution to this - the YolDash application. Through the application, the car owner records the daily route they take and the desired fare, while those using public transportation record the route they take, so both sides can send a request to be travel companions. If the request is mutually verified, the specific points along the route and the time are determined. Thus, the car owner drops off the passenger at the relevant point on the route. For example, Ali, a construction worker, sets off from the metro station with his car around 8:10-8:15 towards the Baku White City business building, marks the route on the map, can take 1 to 3 passengers, etc. Veli, on the other hand, lives near the Science metro station and needs to take public transportation towards the Maiden Tower at those times. Since their routes overlap, the person with the private car can pick up the other person along the way. Every day, thousands of people use this service for 1 manat from the January 20 metro station towards Sumqayit or Koroglu metro station. Also, due to the low fares (for example, 1 manat), sometimes work colleagues hesitate, feel embarrassed to pay partially, or when they own a car, they hesitate to accept payments.

Roughly, one out of every 5 people is a user of this platform.
The platform is designed to reduce urban congestion, introduce the community to parking culture, attract drivers to park, and apply to save the population from spending too much on parking. The platform is managed both through a mobile app and a website.
How does the platform work? The platform operates on an hourly basis. By purchasing a minimum 15-hour package, the user can park their car at any designated parking center. The clock starts ticking when entering the parking lot and stops when leaving. The user can use their 15-hour package within any period (until all hours are used - 1 week, 1 month, etc.).
Within the platform, various package types are available starting from the minimum 15-hour package (standard package). These packages significantly differ from regular parking rates. In addition, users are provided with the nearest parking locations and guided by navigation.
One of the main advantages of this platform is the ability to send these hours to a friend. The other person must also be a ParkMe user. This feature contributes to an increase in the number of users.
The ParkMe platform will be used in existing parking centers with systems such as barriers and cameras. We often forget where we parked our car, but this platform also indicates in which zone (A, B, etc.) or on which level the car is parked.
If the user's hours are up but they have not left the parking lot, their balance will decrease. Settling this negative balance is necessary for the next payment.
Registration on ParkMe: vehicle number, name and surname, email, contact number, and activation through email for the platform. Of course, the payment system on the platform is online (via card). This is both very convenient and secure for users.
Additionally, a calculator is provided for users on the platform. The customer can create their package by selecting as many hours as they want (minimum of 15 hours). Initially, the platform will be valid in leading shopping centers' parking lots and several city parking lots.",,,,,Fk7OAyCKQL,,,,,,,,Affordable and secure online parking platform,,

We try to sell such items through various social networks, some existing websites, or via acquaintances, but often it results in loss of time, or sometimes it is not as easy as we thought.• Looking at the other side of the coin, people with lower financial status, for example, students who come to cities from remote areas to study or families with limited income, seek to find second-hand items easily and from trusted individuals. Occasionally, cases of fraud are brought up regarding some existing websites.• In some cases, people want to donate their items to those in need for help or support, but finding such individuals and delivering the items to them requires a fair amount of time and energy.Idea: The purpose of this idea (mission) is to facilitate easy shopping through the application of second-hand, new, slightly used items.

In this way, the customer (who has the right to use virtual bank services) should automatically be identified after entering all identification information into the system in the appropriate manner by selecting the currency type of the account after accessing the bank's online site (for example, www.xxx.Bank.com) and entering the 'open an account' section on the site. In order to fully activate the account, this virtual account must be linked to a real money source. This can be done by creating two options mainly on the system. The first option allows the customer to enter one or more numbers of the plastic cards they want in their account or the numbers of the current accounts (full number with SWIFT code) with the desired amount remaining in their account. In the future, account numbers for legal cryptocurrencies may also be added to the menu. At this stage, the system should have the ability to quickly verify the status of accounts and the availability of funds in the accounts or cards. Once the customer's online account is fully activated, technical capabilities should be created to carry out any online banking operations (online payments, transactions, etc.) with the funds linked to the virtual account. All these processes are conducted via computer over the internet. For the automation of these processes, IT and software support can be obtained from the respective vendors. Clearing operations during international transfers will take place through correspondent accounts of banks providing plastic cards linked to virtual accounts or current accounts linked to virtual accounts. Project Advantages: Any person authorized by the bank can join the Virtual Bank service. If this service is created, it will provide extensive opportunities for all Azerbaijanis worldwide and strengthen the competitiveness of the banking sector, with Azerbaijan also playing a significant role in online banking services. Expected revenue sources from the project: Service fees based on the commissions and rates set by the bank. Proposal 2: Establishment of an Investment Bank: By creating an Investment Bank, it aims to allow depositors to profit by sharing in the income from projects carried out by the bank and brokers instead of fixed interest income, thus depositors mainly bear the risks themselves. In other words, the bank itself must find and finance various projects and collaborate with depositors to ensure profit. To ensure investment in profitable projects, the bank must form a strong team of experts/brokers. Here, the term 'depositor' legally refers to customers who wish to invest through the bank. Project Advantages: To support our country in attracting more investment, particularly in projects related to the development and industrialization of Karabakh, and to collaborate in many projects implemented by the state by encouraging local currency inflows to new projects in the country. Expected revenue sources from the project: Income from investments, service fees based on the rates. Proposal 3: Establishment of New Agro-Consortiums in Regions and laying the foundation for profitable agricultural production and attracting Investment Banks to these projects Particularly in the Aran regions, by creating the respective Agro Consortiums to attract suitable support to entrepreneurs with limited access to water and such resources, who are unable to maintain their profitability, by purchasing their land plots at a fair price or leasing them for a long period, and attracting new investments to these land plots, by redirecting investments to establish production of the obtained products in industrial enterprises to maximize the system's profitability and direct local investments into this area. Project Advantages: Directing investments to profitable sectors and educating the population on investment. Expected revenue sources from the project: Increasing the value of land plots by purchasing them at market value, creating additional value by converting products not only in raw form but into full industrial products, and more. Proposal 4: Establishing a Construction Company (MMC or MTK), especially by acquiring land plots in Baku coastal and mountainous areas to build villas for sale or rent, and partnering with more experienced individuals in this sector. By placing this information on platforms such as 'Booking.com' or other tourism supporting websites to ensure online reservations, attracting foreign tourists seasonally, and having an important share in the tourism segment. Various discount packages can also be implemented for pre-booked reservations to create customer attraction and satisfaction. Project Advantages: Attracting more foreign tourists to the country and supporting tourism. Expected revenue sources from the project: Sales and rental income.",,,,,BzBHVDNbPa,,,,,,,,Virtual bank,,

We all use different bank cards. + Pashapay, Umico..
Life is getting more complicated. What my offer is about. Simply setting up a special application that works with GPS for relationship with PAŞA Holding.
We want to eat pizza in the city center. But of course we have a desire: to earn cashback from it. What should we do? Normally we should enter Birbank, Pashabank, Umico, see and deal with the partners' shares in each app's UX/UI. 
With the application called ""Cashback City"" (This name is still conditional.) we enter the program, see the stores/restaurants nearby that offer cashback and special discounts, and go to those places just for that cashback. Now when we accidentally see the Umico card in the restaurants, the era of wanting cashbacks is over! We will no longer randomly receive cashbacks at restaurants, we will go to restaurants for cashbacks.
If the Holding wants to spread widely, it can do ""Cashback City"" for all banks. 
For example, if I am stuck between Dominos and Pizza Mizza, I will go to the one where Rabitəbank offers a 5% discount. Now at this time, I do not need to enter the Rabitəbank app, I select the pizza category from the program and see where the highest discounts are, which bank provides them, and how many meters away I am, it shows all. 
With the integration we will make with Google maps, we can also transition to the map very quickly. 
Through this program, we can be more precise to the restaurants, saying that many people come just for your Umico cashback. At this time, restaurants will be more interested in additional cashbacks or commissions.",,,,,Nm5DRNKvEw,,,,,,,,Let every application do its job.,,

PayBox is an intelligent application that helps you reserve all your payments in advance. How does PayBox work? As you know, many people struggle with 'Money Management' and 'Time Management'. The PayBox application will help eliminate these problems. By loading a certain amount to your PayBox account, you will be able to reserve payments in advance for different payments at different times, saving both your time and money. Perhaps with PayBox, it is possible to make advance payments in any category. A person working with a monthly salary of 1000 manats must make various payments in each month. For example: CityNet internet payment - The amount to be paid on the 5th of each month is 30 AZN Utility payments - The amount to be paid on the 10th of each month Monthly 20 AZN home phone payment - The amount to be paid on the 3rd of each month Monthly 5 AZN payment for my child's garden - The amount to be paid on the 15th of each month Monthly 300 AZN parking service - The amount to be paid on the 4th of each month Monthly 75 AZN English Language Course Payment - The amount to be paid on the 20th of each month Total Payment Amount: 500 AZN As you can see, this person regularly spends half of his monthly salary on different payments on different dates. With PayBox, all these payments, when income is credited to the monthly salary account, will be held as reserved payments (pre-payment) according to the payment period set by the person. Payments will be sent to the specified individuals or institutions within the date and time frame indicated by the person. With this function, the person can now easily reserve his payments in advance and spend the remaining amount as desired. Sometimes when we receive our salary, we make many payments, and as a result, we overlook the payments that need to be made monthly. Or we forget to pay on time and therefore the service we use deactivates our account due to additional interest, complaints, or not paying on time. With PayBox, we will now be able to manage our time and money more efficiently by setting the date and time in advance for all payments.",,,,,pGbK0AnSSo,,,,,,,,Reserve Your Payments in Advance!,,

A buy now, pay later plan (BNPL) is a loan offered to a customer at the point of sale so they can purchase merchandise on credit but without a credit card. Popular International options include Shop Pay Installments from Shopify, Affirm, Afterpay, Sezzle, PayPal, and Klarna.
BNPL is an appealing option, as unlike a credit card there is no service fee for customers who pay on time, plus unlike lay-by there is no waiting for the product.
Currently we don't have anything in Azerbaijan, that may work internationally and locally.
Businesses that leverage BNPL can raise revenue, brand awareness and customer loyalty. Increased conversion rates are one of the most immediately evident benefits since customers who leverage BNPL are much more likely to complete a purchase than those who do not. 
Top 2023 BNPL StatsThere are currently around 360 million BNPL users.The BNPL market is worth over $150 billion.16% of 18 to 34-year-olds use BNPL.Clothing is the most popular BNPL purchaseBased on my research, with BNPL model we can cover customers, that haven't been involved as a 1bank customer or those, who don't want be connected with credit cards.

How we will make money?Instead of charging interest from the shop or shopper. BNPL providers make money by taking a percentage from anything they help the retailer sell. One of the main motives for businesses to sign-up for BNPL payment options for their customers is the potential for a significant increase in sales. Many shoppers now prefer the BNPL method as it helps them manage their monthly budget and afford goods they would not be able to pay for in one lump sum. BNPL in particular makes money with transaction fees. Merchants usually pay a BNPL charge ranging from 2 to 8 percent of the purchase amount. Some providers may also charge a flat fee of 30 cents per transaction. Devide (Böl) may provide position of other services offering as a promotion/marketing spend, given that the seller is able to increase traffic &amp; conversion.

Dear Kickbox team,
I want to introduce you to the product 'Outletify'. What is it?
Outletify is an online platform for selling branded products from past collections (Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, Adidas, etc.). Since brands are more interested in selling the new collection, the old collection has to be sold at very low prices or disposed of. We will sell branded products at more affordable prices. Online stores are one of the fastest-growing and successful forms of business today. They allow reducing costs for renting commercial spaces, providing convenience for consumers, and enabling easy scalability. In addition, outlet stores usually have high profitability, as they sell products at prices below market prices. All these factors confirm the viability of the project of an outlet online store for mass markets. Why does our market need this?
With the development of e-commerce in Britain, the USA, European countries, and Turkey, online outlet stores started to appear (giglio.com, outletazpara.com, asos.com), allowing the provision of branded goods at advantageous prices, which will be attractive to people who cannot afford to buy these goods at full price. At the moment, such a platform does not exist in the Azerbaijani market, which in turn hinders the development of this business model. We conducted market research and found that the mass-market audience is interested in buying branded goods. We will establish partnerships with well-known brands and sellers to receive products directly from them and sell them on our online platform 'Umico Market.' Based on our research, we are confident that our project will be very desirable for the mass-market audience. Also, we will have a convenient and intuitively understandable interface part that will allow users to easily find and buy the products they need. In combination, an online outlet store for selling branded clothing can provide customers with high-quality products at a low price, making the project desirable. How does it work? We plan to integrate the product into marketplaces; it will function as a separate product, with products for sale being listed. A commission will be charged for the sale of each product, depending on the category. We will also carry out marketing campaigns to attract new customers and retain existing ones. Our project 'Outletify' meets the modern requirements of the market and society. We plan to establish partnerships only with brands that adhere to environmental standards and produce their products under socially responsible conditions. In addition, our project will help reduce the number of products that end up in landfills and pollute the environment. Further project vision:
Integration of the sale of 'Blue Planet' products (BVLGARI, Nike, Skechers, Courir...)
Integration with 'm10,' 'Kapital bank.'
'Outletify' can partner with 'Kapital bank' to offer special discounts and bonuses to customers who pay for their purchases using bank cards. Additionally, through the bank's platform, the payment process can be simplified and the purchasing convenience for customers increased. 'M10' enabling quick and convenient account top-ups in an online wallet can provide an additional service for outlet store customers. For example, customers can top up their wallet and make purchases in the store without having to enter their banking card details each time. Moreover, the online wallet can offer special discounts or bonuses to outlet store customers. We are confident that the 'Outletify' project will be successful and beneficial to many people. Thank you for your attention and we hope for your support. Sincerely,
",,,,,2BdWb6etQI,,,,,,,,Online sale of outlet goods,,

Many customers cannot obtain products from Umico Market either because they do not have an official workplace or because their budget is insufficient. At the same time, Umico partners cannot sell outlet products to customers at market prices for presentation purposes. Both customers and partners can offer their products for rent on 1care.az. The rental process is carried out by a courier without leaving home.
Description: The customer or Umico partner enters 1care.az and enters the product for rent. The person who wants to rent selects the product, matches it through DVS, and makes the payment. Delivery is carried out via Wolt (payment is made by the party taking the rent). The customer selects the product they have rented to deliver on the platform and delivers it via a courier.
What the holding will earn:
Products offered for rent can be offered to customers on installment or credit basis; A commission of up to 10% will be applied to each payment; Cross-selling of insurance products can be done; Unused real estate of the holding can be rented out; Offer of car and real estate rentals in the future, credit, and insurance products during the rental period.

I propose creating the Electron version of this buddy in the era of digitalization. The program name is 'Digital Buddy'. Covering all customer segments and being closer to them makes our product sales more effective. By obtaining more information about our customers to sell our products, we can offer them the products they need. My proposal is related to creating a Browser Extension. Currently, there are various applications in browser stores (e.g., Chrome Store). The application I propose has the following functionality:
1) When a customer visits a site and sees a product for $5, they click the 'notify me of price drop' button. The program adds the current price to the database. If another user views the same or a different resource of that product and the price is now $4, this information is passed on to the first customer. Our program shares the information obtained about finding the same product cheaper with users. 
2) Currently, large transactions are being made from countries such as Turkey, the USA, and others through couriers. To work with these types of customers, we can provide them with promo codes in our application. For example, a customer visits the www.ebay.com site, clicks on the 'check for discount codes' button in the browser extension, and the program automatically checks and applies the appropriate promo codes. If we apply this to the Zara Azerbaijan site (which offers online delivery services), we can earn a commission fee from the customers we bring in as a cashback service. 
3) Data collection about customer interests. Since the Browser Extension works directly in the customer's internet browser, it tracks their searches. For example, if a person searches for 'places to travel in Canada,' they will be shown an advertisement about the current campaign regarding that through Paşa Travel (email, SMS). If a person searches for which oil to use in a Mercedes W212, they will be offered a partner store. Since these links are obtained through referral links, we receive commissions from our partners for the customers we attract. 
4) With the data collected about customer interests, we can provide them with information about their favorite artists. For example, if a personalized form of the Apple Pay card appears, we can present their card in a personalized format according to their taste. 

Since sales with data are more effective, I believe that the program will be very effective by combining the features I mentioned. Even though it is not an extension that combines these features itself, a similar extension like Honey chrome extension was recently acquired at a high price by a prestigious company like PayPal. I think such applications have great potential. 

The main purpose of the program is the win-win philosophy. There is no losing side: the customer gets a cheap product, we earn commissions from partners, and also gain information about customers and a platform where we can direct our advertisements, and partners gain customer flow. 

The project is not technically complex, promises future financial revenues, and its expenses are not difficult to forecast.

Health insurance and similar insurance products offered to customers during the sale vary depending on their health condition. In other words, being healthy is more profitable :)
Through this project, we can create a local application that offers new Fitness plans for free. Questions necessary for the initial calculation of the insurance fee may be required as mandatory fields at the time of registration. Based on the information obtained as a result, initial insurance quotes can be provided to customers. Additionally, certain goals can be set on the application: for example, if a customer who currently weighs 110 kg will reduce it to 100 kg, they can expect a more discounted insurance fee.
In this way, we not only provide free fitness lessons for people to take healthier steps in life and provide program support where relevant information is provided, but also obtain tools to reach a wider audience with insurance products based on the respective information.
Long story short, this can be integrated into any existing application. It can even be integrated with mandatory medical insurance databases. This is a matter to be decided after evaluating costs and possible alternatives.
Thanks!

Each of us uses various services in our daily lives. However, we often face difficulties in finding quality services at a reasonable price. For example, when renovating a house or looking for a cleaner, people usually rely on their acquaintances because there are no other alternatives and they are forced to trust them. Research shows that in many cases people are not satisfied with their services and the expected quality is not met. Thus, in our society, there are still unresolved problems at the top level. Now imagine a platform that eliminates these problems and combines hundreds of services - Ninjda.az. What is Ninjda.az? Ninjda.az is a platform consisting of two different arms as follows - Service and Rent. 1. Service In this section of the platform, the user finds the necessary services by completing only 3 steps and selects the most suitable one based on price and quality. For this, they complete the following steps: 1. Note the service you need! 2. Get several offers based on your request and compare them! 3. Select the most suitable offer for you and easily solve your problem! Once the process is completed, the service provider contacts the user and provides the service they ordered. What services will be available on the platform? • Cleaning; • Repair; • Transportation; • Private lessons; • Health; • Decor; • Photography; 2.

""Increasing customer loyalty""
The current issue: Customers being unaware of innovations at recreation centers or one-time special offers. Hence, many ""Creative ideas"" have failed. The functionality offered by the ""GoRest"" application divides users into segments based on choices or preferences. During innovations or one-time special offers, the system will segment users and send notifications to invite them to events and offers within the application.
""Proper management of bookings and deposits""The current issue:It's no secret that many places on the market require deposits when making bookings. Establishments accept deposits with a C2C or ""Pay on the spot"" logic. Such customer interactions often lead to dissatisfaction or misunderstandings. The functionality offered by ""GoRest"" proposes the feature of requesting deposits and bookings during registration. When activated, the functionality will facilitate the circulation of deposit and booking fees through ""KapitalBank"" and ""PashaBank"" accounts.

Our idea is offering an online psychological consultation for employees within the PASHA Group. Also, we are not going to offer with just online consultation, we think of adding color to the lives of our employees with projects in the TEDx format, consultations or coaching for employees with physical disabilities. The process will be carried out completely transparently between the psychologist and the employee, and no information will be transferred to the company where he works. And our profit will be human capital, which is the biggest investment. Financially, if we take into account the training and other employee expenses and the time spent to replace the individual who quits with burnout syndrome, to bring a new employee to his level, we will save the company from an additional cost. Carelp also represents the value we place on our colleagues. This idea will add strength not only within the group, but also to our Employer Brand. After a certain period, we plan to sell our product to other corporate companies in order to increase our profitability. For this, we can add this product to the insurance packages. Thus, we will also increase the price of the monthly amount of the insurance packages.

My idea is to prepare electronic versions of these terminals and place them in the busiest places in the city as a pilot project. But how does the electronic version work? Electronic terminals consist only of a monitor. There is no base for collecting cash (which also reduces collection costs and processes). The customer approaches, selects the service to be paid, enters the card information as desired or touches the card (or phone) to the designated location (NFC, which is safer) and completes the payment instantly.

There are several large or small-scale supermarket chains operating on the market. This, of course, reveals certain differences in the competition framework. Each market implements various discounts and promotions to retain current customers and attract new ones. However, these markets highlight these steps on their social networks, websites, or internal ""insert"" journals. This, of course, creates certain difficulties for consumers. In such a situation, the consumer needs to follow all these pages, obtain inserts, etc. It requires a sufficient amount of time, which not every consumer is willing to invest.


Idea


The purpose of this idea is to assist consumers taking into account the facts mentioned above. (For example, let's say a person needs to buy Huggies baby diapers. The price of this product is standard in the market. However, at a certain period, a certain market is offering a week-long discount on that product. The current person using the platform we will create will be informed about this and will buy that product at a discounted price from the market offering the discount) Mission, creating a unique ""discount"" platform to bring together both consumers and markets on this platform. To implement the project, a new application must be developed.


Execution plan


After the application is created, the consumer can easily download the application and see the active discounts in different market chains, certain promotions, and other information. Partners (markets, etc.) can collaborate with us by sharing their information with us to be placed in the application.

Just to give a few examples, I can say that selling medical insurance to healthier people, to people who are likely to have fewer insurance events, is one of our main goals as Pasha Insurance. Considering that a person who spends more time in a place is a healthier person logically, we can reach potential and less risky customers. By using our program, we can offer casco insurance to drivers who are less likely to have accidents by taking into account factors such as braking distance, speed, felt G force in loops, etc., driving to the target address with their own small car. By dividing the areas where people usually spend time into segments, we can offer V.I.P bank or insurance products in relatively expensive places. By using location information, we can analyze the stores that people visit more and offer the products sold in that store category through umico. There are many ideas like this.

Smartphones have become an integral part of our lives, all notes, income, etc. are noted on smartphones. In most cases among bank products within the country, clients' account balances and loans in the credit section are noted. As a personal opinion, I would like to point out that due to clients' obligations being in other outside sections, their responsibility for those credit obligations decreases, and often they forget which expenses they incurred on the card account payments. For this reason, in some foreign countries, there are gadgets that monitor whether the client fully executes his credit and credit card payments according to his registration, categorizes all other expenses according to the assignment throughout the month (communal, shopping, etc.), and have comparative analyses regarding the amount of expenses compared to previous months. In my opinion, such a platform would be useful and attract clients' interest. As a second idea, considering the abundance of cars in the country in recent years, finding parking spaces becomes even more difficult, we make reservations in advance for places like restaurants, etc., but finding a vacant space for a car is difficult, causing loss of time. If there was a parking reservation platform that has already been available in foreign countries for a long time, many people's lives would change for the better. I would like to mention on another platform related to reservations, for every restaurant, etc. place we enter their page separately to make a reservation, take mobile number and keep in touch, this causes loss of time, it would be good to be able to make reservations through a platform with all objects accepting reservations in advance.

Payment methods are no exception. In just a few decades, payment methods have changed from simple cash payments to cashless payments. But as progress continues, cashless payment methods are also evolving. We are all familiar with NFC payments (bank cards), and now there are also payment methods with QR codes and face payments (biometrics). We offer the most modern method - payment by biometric identification based on the palm vein pattern. To make a payment, only presence is required, no cards, phones, or physical money are needed. Payment method: After registering in the App (M10, BirBank, Umico, or an independent program), when making a payment, the buyer brings their hand close to the palm vein sensor (camera) and the payment is instantly processed. Note - the payment is contactless. Advantages and security: No longer do you need to worry about someone stealing your wallet with money and bank cards, or using your face for payment (when you were unaware). It is almost impossible to steal your data. This palm payment method is more accurate and reliable compared to face payment, and is very easy even for elderly people.",,,,,NDfGdpMlCA,,,,,,,,ElPay - Only you are needed for payment,,

Users can also occasionally make changes to these categories (e.g. splitting the 'children' category into two new categories with the names of the children). By automating the process to a certain extent, it is possible to assign certain payments made by card to a specific category based on MCC codes (or on a specific POS terminal), eliminating the need for manual entries by the user. By tracking expenses, information about the user's outstanding debts (e.g. loans not listed in MKR and other bureaus, significant recurring expenses such as a child's tuition fees, rent, etc.) can be obtained. Additionally, there could be an option for the user to also include their 'incomes' in the application, where the user can input their various sources of income into the same field. This information will be transformed into valuable data for the bank during the user's scoring process, converting this field into not only their wage but also additional interest income from other banks, rental income, and so on. To make the addition more engaging, users can be provided with information on how their expenses have changed compared to previous months and suggestions on how to optimize them. This will transform the Birbank application into an interesting tool for customers. For example, the bank might inform a customer that their expenses on the 20th of the month have increased by 15% compared to previous months. Alternatively, reminders could be sent to the customer regarding increases in expenses at certain places like markets, cafes, restaurants, fuel stations, etc., along with related suggestions. Advantages of the project include enhancing the usage of the Birbank mobile application and offering additional benefits to customers, obtaining additional data on customer behavior (prior consent required for usage), acquiring information on other potential incomes of the customer, improving communication by providing recommendations to customers, thereby ensuring loyalty between the customer and the bank. Moreover, the application can become more appealing with various graphics, bar charts, cash flow tables, monthly comparisons, and other elements. This will turn Birbank not just into a mobile banking application but a personal finance manager on the go. Furthermore, by further developing the project, personalizations can be added.

The mentioned service is often expensive and sometimes not measurable. Sometimes individuals, entrepreneurs, large and small companies, startups, or those looking to enter a new business refrain from conducting surveys due to high cost and lack of credibility. At these times, they send out free survey forms to people around them, friends, or on social networks, resulting in very few results or unreliable information. This idea as a vision is about creating a platform in Azerbaijan through the Survee APP, which currently does not have an analogue, with the help of the cheapest and verified users in the country (verified user) to obtain honest answers, and to minimize the group's market research expenditures. The idea is unique and there is no analogue in the local market. In this direction, it has the potential to reduce the group's expenses by up to 2 times. Initially, we will provide companies with a free account balance for acquaintance. Survey participants can easily register with transparent logins, or via financial or mobile phone numbers, and earn income from surveys. According to a verbal survey conducted among nearly 100 different professionals, the majority expressed willingness to download and use such an app. Entrepreneurs, those preparing to start a business, and some large companies have also expressed a desire to take advantage of such an opportunity. The key factor appreciated was that the price is 2 times lower than others and that individuals participating in the survey can determine their own criteria. Additional note: Local survey services are very expensive and not automated. This distances medium, small companies, private entrepreneurs, and individuals from useful survey services for business processes. It leads to incorrect statistics and results. The desire for new businesses to enter the local market from abroad results in financial losses due to starting in the wrong direction. The non-automation of the process leads to a significant loss of time. Our app solves this problem and turns it into additional income for interested individuals. It is twice as cheap as existing survey companies. It is easy and fast for the customer to use. Automated survey templates or the ability to create your own survey form. It provides automated accurate statistics, graphs, and files. Since processes are automated and there is a financial interest for people to participate in surveys, very little time will be spent obtaining results. For PASHA Holding, this app creates the opportunity to survey customer masses suitable for any sector. Surveys can be directed to bank customers, insurance customers, etc. Here, the system also allows these users to belong to the real audience and the specified segment.

In fact, many surveys suggest that people from all kinds of backgrounds say that they want to save money.Yet, many people struggle to save any money at all.

Idea:MatrasAlti is a completely free to use app that is designed to help increase your financial literacy and save your money for a desired holiday, new piece of technology, a brand new car and so on. Piggy bank of needed type is created and a small percentage of your money is added automatically monthly, weekly or even daily. Daily tips and tricks for raising financial literacy of a user are also a part of the app.Here’s how it goes:You connect your card to the app.You create a piggy bank and choose the needed type.You set the deadline, money goal and rules such as process automation (top up holiday piggy bank with fixed amount every time my salary is transferred etc.) with our algorithm helping you.You save your money, whilst the app encourages you as your money saving partner.Reaching various milestones adds benefits and various perks for you.You reach your money goal and withdraw your money for a good use. Sounds like an easy solution to the never ending money saving problem, isn’t it? Not only that, but you also get various discounts and perks if you reach your goal.
MonetizationThe most interesting part - if an app is free for users, how do we actually plan to earn money from it?We project 4 ways for that:Thanks to integrated features for saving money such as process automation and deadlines, monthly cash flow could be projected. Hence, the acquired sum of money could be used for short-term loans with a small interest fee.The deadline feature allows us to offer bank loans for users, whose money goal wasn’t met.Type of product for which the piggy bank would be created gives a room to offer discounts from various businesses who would pay as a fee for each client coming from us.In-app ads  could be shown so users can get various badges and perks as a part of UI/UX gamification.
Potential for growthMore and more features such as group piggy banks, crowdfunding for different goals, and money saving approaches can be applied after acquiring proper users’ behavioral data.Additional ways of monetization could be introduced if proper research is conducted.Even though apps with some of similar features were found when researching competitors abroad (such as Monzo and Monese online banks in the UK, who offer money saving pot feature), they all lack many features compared to the functional complex proposed by our app. Keeping that in mind, if strategic partnership is reached with international banks and institutions, the app has a potential to grow globally.
Thanks for your time reading our idea. We hope you like it and give us a chance.

The financial market of Azerbaijan is full of risks and there is a high demand for financial risk analysis of the banking sector in Azerbaijan. Risk management is a newly emerging section of finance in Azerbaijan. The traditional banking system was built upon credit risk only. However, the scope of risk analysis is broader than that and encompasses the areas such as forex risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, reputational risk, IT risk, operational risk etc. 
Unfortunately, there is not enough human capital and practical business experience to establish such a newly developing section of finance. For that purpose, this start-up project can help to solve this problem in the financial market, especially, in the banking industry in Azerbaijan. 
The main goal of this project is to establish a platform that will help to analyze and estimate the risk profile of financial institutions in Azerbaijan. This is meant to be achieved by the means of establishing a website platform that will individually analyze each commercial bank’s liquidity, credit, interest rate, forex, IT, operation, solvency risks; to rank the commercial banks based on their risk indexes; and provide risk-return matrix for total banking sector in Azerbaijan.  The Structure of the Project:
1)    Risk Health Index (RHI) System:  ·      One of the main functions of the website platform is to provide the RHI system for premium accounts and general database information for general accounts.  ·      The RHI system is meant to estimate and track the risk indexes comprised of the ratios from credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, forex market risk, solvency risk, earning and stability. ·      RHI will be prepared based on the established methodology and ratios and will be standardly applied for each bank and total banking industry with or without systemic banks.  ·      The RHI system is meant to analyze each commercial bank individually, across the banks, and against the total banking industry over the time series, at one point in time, for each individual risk segment and total risk segment. ·      The RHI system will be prepared based on the quarterly published information of the commercial banks. Every quarter the banks publish on their websites the information related to capital adequacy, financial situation report, profit and loss statement, statement of cash flow, leverage coefficients and statements of changes in equity. This information is adequate enough to prepare the financial risk profile of commercial banks. The quarterly published information can be automated and automatically published on the website platform. ·      The RHI system can rank all commercial banks based on their total risk and each risk segment. ·      The RHI system will help to establish a risk index for each commercial bank and compare them with their deposit or bond return, and as a result, a risk-return relationship for each commercial bank can be established. ·      Tracking RHI for all banks across the time will create a database for the risk analysis.

2)  Stress Testing:
·      To understand to what extent each bank can bear the difficult situation, for each bank, liquidity, forex, interest rate, and general balance sheet stress testing will be applied. ·      The stress testing will be conducted quarterly and published on the website platform. ·      The stress-testing patterns will be automated and will be standardly applied to each bank. ·      This will help each individual bank to understand the fragility of their current position if an extreme scenario would emerge.
 3) Risk Consulting: 
·      After establishing RHI and stress-testing system in the website platform, and therefore, creating the brand of the project in terms of risk analysis, the team of the project will engage in the consulting in the risk management section for the financial institution. Who are the Potential Customers?
           The market segment encompasses the legal entities, rather than individual entities. The legal entities include:
·      Financial institutions, especially banks and insurance companies: except for the top three banks in Azerbaijan, the majority of the financial institutions are not successful in establishing their comprehensive risk management system.   ·      Government institutions, such as the Baku Stock Exchange, Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan Banking Association and Azerbaijan Insurance Association have regulative and intermediary roles in the financial market: this project may help them to track the risk of the financial intuitions in a comprehensive manner  ·      Big corporate players and financial institutions that are interested in putting deposits in commercial banks and purchasing the local bonds emitted by the commercial banks: it is expected to be interested in the high interest of big corporate players and financial institutions to analyze the risk profile of the respective commercial banks before engaging in financial transactions and purchases with them. ·      Academic Institutions such as think-tanks and universities mainly engage in academic research and studies. It can be in their high interest to subscribe to platform in order to acquire data. Revenue-Expense Analysis:
1.    Revenues: ·      If the project is established successfully, the following channels are meant to be the provider of the financial resources: ·      Subscription to the platform will require a quarterly fee payment to acquire access to the quarterly estimated RHI index. ·      While establishing the brand in the financial market, the team in charge of the projects will provide risk management consulting services for the financial institutions in return for a financial fee. ·      The website platform will cooperate with financial institutions to advertise their products on the platform in exchange for a financial fee. ·      The platform will constantly conduct surveys in exchange for discounts and financial information to collect the opinion of economic players about the financial market, financial institutions, their products, interest rate etc. The survey results can be used for the benefit of the Pasha Group to understand the domestic market profoundly. Moreover, the survey data can be used as a product of the project to be sold for financial intuitions in exchange for a financial fee based on the established legal terms and ethics. 2.    Expenses: ·      Regular payment for the maintenance, update, and IT security of the platform. ·      Monthly wage cost of labor and team members 3.    Cost of the Project: ·      The expected cost of the project mainly covers the establishment and development of the comprehensive website platform, which requires the IT services such as back-end, front-end, java developer, designer etc. Challenges and Long-run Target: ·      The quarterly published information by the commercial banks does not cover the data about operational, IT and reputational risk. This limits RHI analysis and stress-testing to the financial aspects of commercial banks. One of the ways to overcome the mentioned challenge is to establish partnerships with the subscribers and acquire their data based on established legal terms. ·      In the short run, the primary goal is to increase the number of partners as much as possible to ensure the normal operation and functioning of the platform. In the long-run, as the brand in a risk analysis will be established by the project, the project team will start to provide consulting services for the financial institutions. Criteria Satisfaction:
1.    Contextuality:  ·      The main assets of Pasha Holding (PH) concentrated on financial institutions (FI) such as Pasha Bank, Kapital Bank, Pasha Insurance, Pasha Life Insurance, Pasha Kaptial. ·      The FIs of PH purchase financial securities (mainly bonds), conduct deposit swap operations, have term deposits and give credit to other local Azerbaijan banks.  ·      This project helps to understand the possible risks of the local banks that are conducted business with, search for alternative less risky banks, and to understand what is the macro risk picture of banking system in Azerbaijan.  ·      Therefore, this project directly serves to sophistication of business activities of FIs of PH and help to effectively and efficiently minimize the redundant risk while engaging in banking business with other banks. 2.   Material Viability:  ·      The subscription fee: the main source of revenue will come from the potential subscribers of the platform will be insurance companies, commercial banks, government institutions, legal entities, academic institutions in the form of subscription fee. ·      Advertisement activities: as the platform focuses on the banking system, the platform will be a good hub for the banks who are conducting marketing strategies and releasing advertisements in return to advertisement fee. ·      Consulting fee: there is a high demand for the specialists who can create the system of interest rate risk on banking book, forex risk, investment risk and other type of market risk analysis for commercial banks, along with necessity for sophistication of credit, liquidity, operation, and IT risks of commercial banks. Emphasizing the lack of specialists in the mentioned areas of risk analysis, the team who will establish the platform can serve as a consultor for local commercial banks and generate consulting fee. 3.   Non-Material Viability: 1)    Information Benefit: ·      While purchasing the bonds of the commercial banks and deciding to put deposits in the commercial banks, the platform will provide full information about the risk profile of the commercial banks, including RHI and stress tests.  ·      The data collected from the survey will provide information for the Pasha Group to analyze the market profoundly. 2)    Reputational Benefit: ·      as the platform will operate under the umbrella of the Pasha Group, it will maximize the scope of business and prestige of the Pasha Group  4.    Feasibility: ·      The two elements that are necessary for the creation of this platform are Human Capital and Availability of Data.  ·      Firstly, Human Capital consists of IT specialists and financial risk analysts. IT specialists will be needed for establishing, securing, and sustaining full-functioning platform. ·      Financial risk analysts will be needed to conduct the analysis and estimations in different areas of banking risks.  ·      Both type of Human Capital components are highly available and I personally talked with the specialists from Pasha Holding, Kapital Bank, Pasha Life Insurance and Pasha Bank and realized their high willingness in participating in this project.   ·      Secondly, availability of data is another matter of issue.  ·      Since 2016, the commercial banks in Azerbaijan quarterly produce raw information about financial statements, balance sheet statements, capital adequacy statements, cash flow movement statements and other type of reports necessary for analyzing the financial situation of commercial banks.  ·      The raw information can be analyzed and transformed into risk analysis estimations.  5.    Desirability:  ·      I conducted interviews with the high-rank risk specialists from Pasha Bank, Pasha Life Insurance, Kapital Bank and Pasha Holding (totally 7 people) about the desirability and necessity for such a system.  ·      As result of these interviews, there was a unanimous opinion about the detailed risk analysis of the banking sector in Azerbaijan.   ·      Since the 2015-16 crisis, the commercial banks in Azerbaijan conducted several operations to minimize their risk and sustain their banking business. ·      However, whether they really managed to efficiently minimize their risk, or whether they can survive any future possible economic crisis is under a huge question.  ·      Instead of allocating human and financial resources to analyze the a small portion of the other bank’s financial risk, this platform will be able to readily demonstrate all type of risks, their ranking, their satisfaction criteria for all 26 banks in Azerbaijan since 2016 on quarterly basis, in return to a small amount of fee   ",,,,,LdV6Ve1JWU,,,,,,,,To analyze and estimate the risk profile of local banks,,

How will this work? The system will take orders from customers mainly in voice mode, but will also provide the option to select items. These orders will be taken by an operator who will not be our employee. In other words, these workers, taking orders and placing orders, will earn a percentage of Y after the completion of the same orders. Once the orders are processed, the system will send them back to the customer for confirmation in a visually readable format with images of the products. Here will be indicated the cost of each item and the cost of the service. The cost of the service will be dynamically measured according to several criteria. As soon as this list is confirmed by the customer, the system will send it to a courier located near the delivery address. The courier will purchase the item at the nearest ""Bravo"" branch with his own money and will only receive the amount of the completed order after delivering the item to the customer. The courier will transfer part of the cost of the service to the designated card account, from which part of this amount will be credited to the operator and the cost maintenance system. As a result, this system will allow increasing sales and additionally attract citizens as an opportunity to earn.

Our application offers:Prepayment or deposit functionality: Coffee addicted customers who purchase coffee often, can use this option as saving time and money in coffee orders by paying upfront amount and getting coffee vouchers. Every coffee shop can offer their own vouchers at a discounted price to customers. This functionality also gives access to quick cash for day-to-day operations for coffee shops and cheaper prices and flexible service for customers.Pre-order functionality: Coffee shops have almost become “third place” (after home and work) for people. It affects the number of people visiting coffee shops and increases waiting minutes for customers. By using the pre-order function, we can avoid long waiting minutes and get our coffee in a moment’s notice. Customers may pre-order their coffee and collect it on arrival.Feedback, review and rating functionality:  We aim to provide social platform for customers where they can provide their comments and feedback based on their customer experience in different categories (service, price, brand, quality of product, design of place etc.)Location based search: This function aims to provide good guidance for the customers without coffee experience in finding nearest/preferable coffee shops by applying filtered and non-filtered options. The filtered option is based on the above-described criteria.Point/cash back function:  For reducing the printing of paper loyalty cards, this function offers digitalized cash back/point system for customers and coffee shops. We reduce the risks of losing/damaging loyalty cards and carriage of cards in your pocket or wallet. We also aim to offer exchanges of points between coffee shops.Coffee market database: Currently coffee market lacks of information(Azerbaijan Coffee Market especially) of coffee consumption rate, trends, product types, demographic distribution of coffee drinkers, age, sex distribution of coffee market. This functionality aims to produce reasonable and reliable data for the coffee market. Marketing tool/channel: Currently, customers do not get information relating to the campaigns which are organized by coffee shops. Also, there is lack of individual customer approach in coffee market. In order avoid these problems, we offer customer based notification function for increasing and maintaining customer awareness and brand loyalty about new products, discounts, campaigns, new branches and new coffee brands penetrating to the market. What is more, this info could be used for consulting purposes to give reliable data about the country’s coffee market.",,,,,wztpTcA7rh,,,,,,,,Connecting Coffee Brands and Coffee Lovers.,,

The financial reports will be quarterly shared to the public. The Executive Board will be created to maintain the transparency in the management, firstly on a volunteering basis, later on, on salary basis.  In the beginning the money will be used solely for Thalassemia patients and for the development of the fundraising organization. In the future, Fundraising Organization will become independent from Thalassemia Federation and will serve in many different directions, such as Thalassemia, Cancer, Research, Surgery and so on.  Fees will be used to cover operational costs, development of the organization and future dividends to investors. 
I used to work for Fundraising Organization in England and found out that nearly everyone in England is subscribed for some social fundraising campaigns. This idea is widely practiced in European countries as well, however in Azerbaijan there is no organization that is totally devoted to fundraising activities and works on monthly subscription basis. I have contacted the president of Thalassemia Federation and agreed to create this organization within their Federation. In the beginning they will help me to provide a platform for the fundraising activity. In the future, the fundraising organization, AzFund, will become independent and serve other disease treatments and research as well. 
First of all, I am planning to work on legal part of the idea to find out how it can be created and managed withing the law, and creation of the organization.  Secondly, I am planning to create agreements (to deduct salary automatically each month) and communicate the idea within Strategy Assets of PASHA Holding using my network and communication team, to involve more people as a testing phase. Later on, will launch it in a country level.   
Taking all above mentioned, I am applying to kickbox in order to create a team to work on this idea and get first financial aid to start the organization.",,,,,afZ1GPVFlK,,,,,,,,Social work enlightens your inner world.,,

We are part of a large business system, in an environment where technology is advancing every day, each of us strives to adapt to this advancement, but the most important part of this complexity is the continuous communication among employees within large companies (here, whether among members of the same company or among several or all employees who make up the Group) and engaging in collaborative idea exchange. My proposal on this important topic is in two forms: The first form - creating an internal social network or portal for the Group - For example, like the Kapital Bank internal Assembly portal, but the most important difference will be that along with its internet format, it will also have a Mobile format. The key here is that employees will maintain online communication with each other, hold live meetings (or open a live broadcast on their profile on social networks to bring up various topics or problems and receive live feedback), share video and image-formatted Posts where important topics in daily work life will be discussed, and. etc. will be exchanged through sharing and communication forms. The second form is - F.A.Q-Tea&amp;Coffe-This is not online, but physically coming together by organizing meetings between employees. Here, the Tea-Coffe places I refer to are rooms in each of our Group's main office buildings, but it is important to have a large hall so that more colleagues can be present (of course, it should be a space designed with attractive and comfortable tea and coffee types and various designs to create more interest). These places will involve the participation of both the company it is located in and, most importantly, other members of other companies within the Group. Our main goal is the purification of energy, further development of togetherness, and discussing current issues in place. I would like to explain the topic in a long format, but I thought I should first explain the main goal, and if interested, I can provide a more detailed explanation later, thank you in advance.",,,,,a1xGwnGYJl,,,,,,,,The main goal of my idea is to increase PAŞA Group's internal energy,,

Online platform for booking services. There are places and establishments where it is practically impossible to get in without a prior appointment, for example: clinics, beauty salons, cafes and restaurants, cargo transportation services, etc. And here comes to the rescue our service booking platform - BronEt. No need to search for doctors' contacts, restaurant reviews, spots in salons, all of this will be gathered on a single platform. How will the BronEt app work? The client wants to see a gastroenterologist, he enters the app, types in the clinic name/doctor's name/word gastroenterologist and the system offers him options depending on the search parameters. The client clicks on the suitable option, chooses the day, time, and books the necessary service (doctor consultation, lab tests, ultrasound, etc.). He is given a registration ID number which he uses to avail the service at the appointed time. Each partner (clinics, cafes and restaurants, beauty salons) also has this system where they can see all the bookings (customer appointments). Upon customer arrival, they request the ID number, after which the client can use the service. Payment for the service can be done both online (except for cafes and restaurants) and offline. Our revenue will consist of a commission on the service for which the client is booked. If he books an appointment with a doctor, then the commission will be deducted from that amount. Why will clients use this application? - convenience and time-saving: no need to search for establishment contacts on social media or ask friends for advice on where to go to a doctor, for breakfast, for a manicure, etc., no need to spend time making calls to the registration center and finding an available slot, just a few clicks directly from the phone are enough; - wide choice: when searching for a beauty salon, the system will first provide the nearest location options, in addition, you can adjust suitable parameters yourself and read client reviews; - awareness of all discounts, promotions at establishments of interest to the client, special promo codes for repeat services. Why will partners join the BronEt system? - flow of new customers and increasing revenue, as a client coming in for one procedure may avail of others; - over time, no need to maintain a large team for client registration (advantage for clinics). And now about the 4 main criteria of the BronEt project: - the platform will be in the form of an application for clients and as a web browser for partners; - with this application, clients will save time, which is lacking today, no calls and reviews in social networks; - our profit will be a commission from each transaction, that is, from the used booking; - currently, there is no such service in Azerbaijan that would encompass all the services people use.

Buying goods or acquiring services at a discount is pleasant for everyone. But not everyone manages to keep track of them on social networks or not everyone finds it convenient to receive numerous SMS messages. After conducting a small survey, I saw that there is a huge number of people who want to purchase a product advantageously but do not know where to find information about discounts. And  I came to the conclusion that it is necessary to create a platform (application) that will display all this information. Discounts will be categorized into: · Clothing, footwear, and accessories · Restaurants and hotels · Sports · Health · Household appliances and electronics · Services, etc. So the customer, by choosing a category, partner, and even location, can see the corresponding discounts (discount size, expiration time). Additional features may include: · Discounts for segmented customers (seniors, students, etc.) · Purchase of special discount coupons · Purchase of virtual gift cards from individual brands Additional features can be added after launch. Why will the idea take off? The project will be very successful, because there is no similar platform in Azerbaijan and based on the survey results, it will be very useful for many. The application will be interesting not only for buyers but also for partners (there will be active customer attraction through our application). What values will our Holding gain? It will be the first customer-oriented platform of its kind in the country and it will be launched by our Holding. Additionally, the Holding will earn percentages from partners for displaying brands at the top, etc. Technically, it will be a free mobile application for Android and iOS users MVP, RAT, Average check, trend analysis, and market analysis will be provided in subsequent stages.",,,,,pJEPdFYczW,,,,,,,,discount,,

Online platform is being created. Physical citizens entering this platform can invest in real business activities. Citizens investing are provided with a guarantee letter from the bank. Based on the guarantee letter, the funds of the investing citizen are considered fully insured.
A brief description of the operations is as follows:
Taxpayers engaged in real business activities on the online platform are registered. Registered taxpayers note their investment needs (amount) to expand their business activities.Physical citizens enter the platform and select one of the appropriate real business activities for themselves and make investments through the platform. At the time of their investment, an amount covered by a bank guarantee is provided to the citizen and necessary contracts are signed online through the platform. The investment amount is deducted from the citizen's own account on the platform and transferred to the real business (taxpayer's account).At the end of the investment contract period, the funds invested by the physical citizen along with additional interest income are transferred to the taxpayer by the taxpayer, according to the terms of the investment contract. If the taxpayer does not pay the intended funds to the citizen at the end of the period, the funds to be received by the citizen are fully guaranteed by the bank based on the respective bank guarantee, and the taxpayer's obligation is created in front of the bank.Guarantee letters provided by the bank in the name of the taxpayer are presented on a cash cover or giro basis.

Thank you for your attention.

There are existing companies in the international market such as HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, Yelp, and others. Our vision is to be the first platform to come to mind by creating additional value for interested parties in the service sector. With the presented idea, we believe that we will solve many of the current problems listed below:* Uncertainty of service prices.* Construction or repair taking longer than anticipated.* Difficulty in finding professional craftsmen.* Lack of trust in service providers (in terms of safety)* Incomplete work left by the craftsman in many cases.* Failure to provide guarantees for the work done.* Most of the payments being made only in cash form.* Customers delaying payment for various reasons.* Lack of consistent orders.* Hardship for professional craftsmen due to inexperienced craftsmen in the market.* Informal employment.* Limited access to financial resources.* Customers not being sufficiently recognized among clients.* Payments not being made on time or in the specified amountThe operational process of the platform will be as follows briefly:1. Customers will enter information about their location and the required service on the site2. The platform will then share the information with relevant service providers operating in the area of the inquiry3. Next, service providers will present their proposals within suitable terms for the required job4.

The banking industry is forced to adapt as online services and the boom of platform economy develop. To meet the expectations of customers and the market, oriented towards digital technologies, the creation of a fully digital bank is envisaged.


The classic mobile applications of banks are often either limited in functionality and require a visit to the branch, or are difficult to navigate due to a complicated interface. Digital Bank of Pasha prioritizes convenience for the customer.






Digital Bank of Pasha is a fully digital bank that can be downloaded to a smartphone as an application, as well as to messengers through bots, and remote access to all banking services.






Traditional banks charge a 3-5% commission for cross-border transactions. DBP consciously does not charge a transaction fee and compensates with an efficient business model, as well as commissions from other services.




Key ideas:


Plastic card is not mandatory. Electronic piggybank - marketing research shows that customers round up the purchase amount to the nearest whole number. For example: buying a cappuccino for 4.50 ₼, the remaining 0.5 ₼ is credited to the customer's electronic piggybank. The currency of the electronic piggybank is chosen by the customer, assuming that cryptocurrencies will also be available. Electronic card, with which purchases can be made abroad at the interbank rate. Cash withdrawal contactlessly abroad in foreign currency without conversion fee. (Suitable for expats and tourists) Document management with ASAN imza. Social trading - Thanks to users, their collective knowledge and experience can be transformed into practical trading tools. Automatic cashback allocation after purchase to the balance ""ƏDV GERİ AL""

This means a constant increase in the need for spare parts and repairs.
Currently, when we search for a spare part for any car, we mainly have to spend hours, sometimes even days, visiting various used spare part stores, creating connections, and asking around. Sometimes, we may even have difficulty explaining what spare part we need because we don't know its name. This platform allows us to obtain the spare part with a single query by noting the necessary information. The query is submitted to the stores in a notification format and they send their offers in a very simple way. We can then choose the most suitable offer from the incoming offers.
Another issue is the addition of repair history. As a result of a small survey we conducted (180 people), we found that 80% of car owners want to keep their repair history but are struggling to do so. This platform allows drivers to automatically keep their repair history. So, if I don't have my logbook with me, I can record it on the computer when I get home, or the problems of those who want to keep their history in different ways are solved. In addition, along with other potentially needed features (Product image, location, mechanic, etc.)
Furthermore, there is a general search page for mechanics, stores, services, and comprehensive information about each service area (General information, business hours, service area, address on the map, and reviews and prices given by drivers). This will enable finding a professional mechanic in a short time when there is a need for repair in any field (electric, locksmith, etc.).

An online platform that will bring together all shops and services and help the ordinary consumer buy a gift certificate in any category. All brands and services gathered on one platform. Starting from fitness clubs, spa salons, certificates for the purchase of electronics, books, consultations with a psychologist, photo sessions, language and computer courses, bowling, yacht trips, paintball, museum visits, ending with certificates for the purchase of jewelry. Many companies are also looking for motivational gifts for employees or birthday and holiday gifts. 
The certificate can be for each segment separately or one certificate that can be used in different segments.

Our customers can register on this platform, create a profile, and sell their products. This will help us attract new customers. When we attract a new customer, we inform them that they will not only benefit from competitive rates but also gain access to a large customer base. We will facilitate the financial transactions between customers and provide an additional source of income. Let's allow customers to display their products on the platform and share their website, email, and phone numbers. Other customers can view this information and make purchases from those who sell the desired products when there is a demand. This way, our customers will gain additional clients, and we will facilitate the financial management of their businesses, offering guarantees, letters of credit, and trade finance solutions. We can impose a requirement on customers that if they want to access this customer base, they must only collaborate with our bank. If they collaborate with another bank, they will be removed from the platform, and their banking fees will increase. Later on, we will also provide access to Pasha Bank Turkey and Pasha Bank Georgia customers, expanding the export potential and access to customer bases in foreign countries. We could also offer access to the Umico market's customer base if there are businesses engaged in B2B within it. Additionally, for customers who register on the platform and are identified as having a certain turnover or income, we can provide access to training related to sales and management on the iSpring platform as part of a loyalty program.

Brief description“excite” is a unique platform for Azerbaijan. It will provide solutions to our daily questions on the platform that will be used in the form of an app. For example, when we want to go to a restaurant with our friends and at that time instant questions arise: Which restaurant? What cuisine? Will there be a table available at the right time? If our favorite restaurant is full, is there another suitable one at the same place or time? And where are the best prices? How can a reservation be made? How will the service quality be? And so on.And in other cases, similar questions arise when we need accommodation (for ourselves or for a guest coming from outside): Is there a hotel of our choice? Is it possible to rent a house for daily rent (Airbnb)? Which was the best offer in terms of price? Will we like it? And so on.The system or platform will help match the user (any person) with the seller (the subject providing the service; restaurant, hotel, etc.) in a mutually beneficial way.
BEFORE PLUNGING INTO RESTAURANTS, PUBLIC CATERING (CHILDREN'S ENTERTAINMENT PLACES, etc.) LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF THE SYSTEM.
Usage formFor Restaurants -       Registered restaurants in the system enter their menus, photos, and other information. In addition, the restaurant categorizes itself into Premium, Medium, and Budget categories (this can also be done based on the volume of the average check in the restaurant);-       The restaurant registers either a bank card or a bank account;-       The restaurant also classifies itself based on the cuisine category it presents (national, European, etc.);-       Each restaurant has its own profile, ",,,,,w3qee0eTHA,,,,,,,,easy solution; smart reservation; free loyalty program.,,

RateIT is a project that works to maximize customer satisfaction and service levels in all service areas. The RATEIT project is not a project that has been thought of for years. This is a necessity. As soon as we explain, actually, you will agree with me, you will remember any event that happened to you yesterday, today, or a week before. This could be a good, bad, or unforgettable experience for you. RATEIT will sometimes help you, sometimes help others benefit from your experience. When we say experience, it can basically be good or bad. Of course, the good and the bad have their own degrees. RATEIT will take this into account. But now, to understand the nature, we will focus on two main experiences. Good and bad. RATEIT presents you all service providers for all fields and types of services in a list format. Along with the list, it provides barcodes for evaluating some types of services on-site. You choose the service area and share your experience on the RATEIT platform. If the service area is not in the list, if there is no barcode, you can send it as a suggestion to the system. You can share your experience, make your choice based on the opinions of others. This will allow you to make decisions based on the thoughts of others, saving you time, energy, and budget.
As RATEIT, we have chosen to eliminate the negativities in the market, increase the level of service, and establish the relationship between the user and the service provider as a goal. Let's look at a real example:
Imagine that you need to organize an event soon. This event, be it a wedding, engagement, birthday, corporate gathering, etc., is an important event for you and will leave a mark on your life. For such an event, the most important thing is the venue. How will you make your choice? You will take advice from relatives, friends, visit various venues, make phone calls, research on social media profiles, etc. Here, the opinions of people who have used that venue before, based on real experience, will be more important. As for you, when making a choice, you lose both time, money (transportation expenses, phone bills, etc.), and most importantly, energy. Now let's look at the selection process of a RATEIT user:
To make a selection, all he needs is internet, phone, or computer. He enters the portal, applies the necessary filters, and makes his choice based on hundreds of real experiences. In addition to opinions, he is offered real photos of the venue, video clips, the possibility of virtual tours, menus, even live consultation, to facilitate his decision. He makes his choice, and then he doesn't forget to share his opinion with other users :) That simple. He doesn't get stuck on the roads, doesn't spend 1-2 hours on the phone, isn't lost among what he wrote in his notebook.
As RATEIT, we aim to connect the service provider with the user, minimize disputes between them, and plan to improve the level of service. How does this happen? When a user gives a negative review about the service provider (this can be through a barcode or a mobile app in that venue), the service provider is immediately notified, and the provider communicates with the dissatisfied customer to resolve the issue. Later, the review that appears as a complaint on the RATEIT platform is marked as resolved. This directly affects the provider's rating on the platform. Also, during positive reviews, a notification is sent to the provider, who thanks the customer on the platform, shows attention with a small gesture. Additionally, RATEIT enables service providers to create direct interaction with their customers, deliver innovations, discounts directly to them. This reduces their advertising expenses, increases customer loyalty.
In addition to service providers, RATEIT keeps its users in constant focus, offering special discounts, campaigns on their birthdays, special days.
The discounts offered to users by RATEIT are applied to all service providers through a unified system, and users do not need tens of discount cards.
Most importantly, discounts will be calculated on an individual basis. For example: A product sold for 1000 manats in a store, if it is 900 AZN for Ali, it will be 950 AZN for Veli.

The rating process is carried out in a 5-point system, and comments are made with static sentences (initially). For example: great!, the food was delicious, but the service was poor, etc. When the user verifies their account (there will be certain requirements), they can write any review they want. Users will have ranks, and based on activity, ranks will increase, providing new opportunities for these users. Users can follow users who have the rank of expert, benefit from their choices.
RATEIT initially offers service providers a free trial period. During this period, customers can provide both positive and negative reviews, and service providers can benefit from all the features of the platform. When the trial period ends, providers are required to subscribe for a monthly fee. Upon subscription, they continue to benefit from all the platform's features. If they do not subscribe, restrictions are applied to their use. For example, restrictions are applied to positive reviews, contact information of users who give negative reviews will not be published, etc.
RATEIT also offers social clubs to its users. For example: members of the SUSHILOVERS club can discuss the best sushi places within the group (discussions are not free as air, follow a standard template of questions presented by the admin, such as: place (multichoice), date (multichoice), etc.), can go to the selected place together. Later, users are given the opportunity to rate the X place by the SUSHILOVERS club :)",,,,,uZkZ98ZGBg,,,,,,,,Share experience and improve it.,,

The distant work and learning environment, agile management principles, increasingly digitized products and services further strengthen the globalization trend. To adapt to the VUCA world, business processes must be constantly renewed, and new knowledge and skills must be added to job responsibilities. Newly hired employees must adapt to their roles quickly, while current employees must acquire new knowledge interactively, digitally, anytime and on any device. Time is precious here! Conducting concrete and interactive trainings often requires a lot of time, human resources, and budget. Taking these considerations into account, we first decided to create new digital development content (e-learning courses) at PAŞA Hayat company. Throughout 2021, we managed to create more than 10 interactive learning courses on various topics. By automating the adaptation process at work, we were able to make this process more efficient for new recruits. Content was created on important topics such as risk management, information security, systems engineering, customer services, feedback skills, and other essential subjects, made available for employees to use. We propose creating a special team (7-8 members) to share this innovative approach and acquired experience in PAŞA Holding companies. The team, called Dtech (development technology), will be able to create digital content for development areas needed in the Holding companies, such as: 1) E-courses 2) Video courses 3) Video tutorials 4) Podcasts 5) Interactive quizzes and keys 6) FAQs and E-books The created digital content can be viewed limitlessly by employees on any Learning Management Systems (LMS). Moreover, digital content on general business topics can be offered for sale to local and foreign companies. In the near future, Dtech team plans to implement more modern and effective 3D and Virtual Reality technologies in the learning and development field. If we aim to be a pioneering technological and innovative company, then our learning and development experience must undergo serious transformation. As the Dtech team, we are ready to take on this responsibility and become the first technological development center at the Holding and country level.

YouAtWork is aimed at simplifying the operations of small and medium-sized businesses through a Cloud ERP platform. The platform will initially include the following modules.

- HR Employee Info Payslip Vacation KPISurvey
- CRM
- Inventory Warehouse management Product Lifecycle Management Easily manage suppliers &amp; purchase orders
- Task management
- Document management

Modules and submodules can be customized. It is planned to add them to the platform based on companies' proposals.

When it comes to the Cloud platform, the software will be hosted on servers located in the Republic of Azerbaijan. Each person can register their company at any time and start using the platform as soon as they fill in all the necessary information. There will be a certain period (trial period) during which the platform will be free for those companies.

We consider module, number of users, type of service, and monthly/annual subscriptions as the basis for pricing.

Most companies either purchase ready-made software internally or develop their own. When software is purchased, as it needs to be installed on their internal servers, sales and service of the software require a high amount. As the company's sector is not IT, even when developed, the software may not be of sufficient quality, which requires hiring employees and thus leads to high expenses.

The main target audience of the platform is initially small and medium-sized businesses. In an era where digital transformation is on the rise, the YouAtWork platform will allow companies to free up additional IT resources or reduce costs. Users will be able to manage most of their operations from a single platform.

After the platform is developed, companies under Pasha Holding can also use it. Pasha Holding can offer its corporate clients or companies using this platform the products of holding companies.

It is a common practice that gives you the opportunity to buy a car and make significantly lower monthly payments.
GFV financing is calculated according to the future value of the vehicle. Monthly payments are calculated on the difference between the purchase value and the future stipulated value of the car. 
There are several conditions as long as the car is in the customer's possession:
1. A fixed term contract (24-48 months)  
2. Maintenance conditions (e.g. the vehicle is serviced at authorized service centres)
3. A specified maximum number of kilometres per year that can be driven.
4. The condition of the vehicle by the end of the contract period.
When the contract expires, there are three options: 
1. Trade in
2. Buy the car
3. Return the car to the company
If the customer decides to trade in the vehicle, he can choose GFV or another type of financing to buy a new car. If the choice is to keep the car, he has to pay for it in full or refinance it. Or he can simply return the car without any further expenditure if complied with all the contract conditions.
Given that operational leasing will involve close cooperation among banks, insurance companies and car dealers, I think this project deserves the attention of potential sponsors.
This idea can be implemented as a stand-alone company or converted into a product and exploited in one of the PH Banks.",,,,,awSKlGI9S6,,,,,,,,"Drive New, Pay Less. ",,

In fact, most of them have very short lifecycle. Most of the times it is because of either lack money and consultancy, or dissatisfaction of income. Governments are interested in transformation of SMEs to big companies. Small business is small tax.

We design, you succeed.

With the fast paced growth of technology in today's reality,imagining a business without a website or a social media page is like imagining an Azeri person who doesn't like çay. Taking into consideration the fact that remote learning opportunities and the number of educational courses in Baku growths from day to day,there are hundreds of young,creative and ambitious designers and developers in our country. All these talented people are waiting for their chance to shine. In our country without mentioning the big well known companies and holdings,with the help of comfortable conditions for enterpreneurship and business,there are a lot of new companies on the market. What do these two have in common? The desire to develop their business to the maximum. As was mentioned earlier,design and the representation of a business online is more than important for the organisation. The opportunities to get that high quality suitable design however is not so diversified in our city. Some companies tend to hire designers from abroad and our designers without having a platform in order to reach out for local employers tend to work remote for abroad companies.Now this is where Ю&amp;X Smart Solutions comes in. We tend to establish an open space platform for designers in our country to be able to work and develop themselves and would bring service to companies in the local market.
Why is it helpful: Considering todays market of designers in Baku,the majority are people who worked in printing houses 15-20 years ago and are implementing the design schemes today however which are far away from todays trends. There are a lot of designers honored with international recognitions,but who work more for international companies and not for local ones. There are a lot of young talented designers in many fields who have a shortage of work experience and for that reason could not get a job,however provide high quality. Our organisations unites and provides a chanel between designers and companies who need their service. 
How do we earn: Taking the standart prices of design services in local and international companies,we would earn from projects implemented to us. We would offer the biggest range of service in the country:Graphic DesignUx\UI DesignMotion DesignProduct DesignSocial Media Marketing ServicesVideography ServicesAnimation CreationPhotography Services SMMBranding from A-Z and many more

No soil is required for cultivation as soilless cultivation technology is used. Light, water, and temperature inside the farms are pre-programmed, so the results are always predictable in terms of quality, volume, and taste characteristics. Products are not contaminated by parasites and diseases, thereby pesticides are not used. Lighting, humidity, CO2 levels, and nutrition are adjusted separately for each culture and regulated. 
From this, the main advantages can be derived:
Always fresh produce - manufacturing can be placed inside cities: 1-3 hours from harvest to store, restaurant, hotel.
Pesticide-free cultivation - a closed air cycle and controlled microclimate inside the farm eliminates the use of pesticides.
Space saving - these vertical layers save space. No soil load, farms can be installed in basements, workshops, factories, etc.
Water saving - Vertical farms consume 95% less water than traditional agriculture.
Eco-friendly - no carbon footprint - no transportation over long distances. 
Reduction in labor costs - process automation allows the reduction of the number of employees involved in production.
Reduction in logistic costs - production, warehouse, and storage in one place.
The current business project also complies with all the values of Pasha Holding. Since the project implies the development of the non-oil sector, the use of modern technologies, possible cooperation with Absheron Hotel Group, Saffron Restaurants, Bravo, and other agribusinesses under the holding (collaboration). This project also involves the cultivation of organically clean and quality products (quality). This innovation is new in our country and will best reflect the entrepreneurial spirit of the holding (entrepreneurship). In the long term, it is expected to be highly profitable, as the development of this technology will lead to increased profitability. An automated and transparent system will allow the development of an open and useful project for our country without any risks for production (integrity).
Depending on the areas and investments, the payback period ranges from 3 to 6 years. In the income statement, both the sale of finished products and the sale of technologies, turnkey construction of agrofarms can be added. The use of forecast technologies in cultivation can be a very good opportunity for restaurant and hotel businesses to avoid logistical shocks in global supply and the risk of product shortage. 

For the MVP of this business, a ready-made technology in a 20-foot container can be used for production. The cost of this mini-factory can vary around 50,000 manat. The payback period is 6 years. The easy relocation possibility will allow placing the production right next to the consumer (restaurant, hotel). Remote management system will enable climate control, watering from an ordinary smartphone. Cultivation area - 25 sq.m. The main expense item is electricity. 

The demand for this product is evident, as there is no producer who can offer the required products in fresh form at all times of the year. The flexible production of these farms allows growing the exact culture that is in demand and necessary in the market. Cultures that were impossible to cultivate in Azerbaijan due to the climate can now be easily produced. Predictability will allow Azerbaijani businesses to pre-calculate demand and sales plans.

One of the main and important directions of this project can be the assistance in accelerating the restoration of Karabakh. Since the territories are in poor infrastructural condition, it takes years to develop and grow agriculture in these regions.

Events are referred to vendors or event companies. Event managers, as intermediaries, offer services at higher prices by adding additional charges to the existing prices (administrative fee, profit interest, extra expenses, etc.). We, on the other hand, due to not signing separate contracts for services in each event (many work only with cash payments), are obliged to cooperate with the companies that win the tender and lose 25% of the money in each order. (In a 50,000 AZN budget event, this means losing 12,500 AZN). However, through the central agency, we can provide fixed prices for services from the best vendors at the initial stage to the customer. This way, not only to the companies within PASHA Group, but also by creating our own brand and utilizing our internal resources and advantages (restaurants, hotels, etc.), we can offer innovative and different services to local market customers. Advantages: 1) cost saving 2) fixed prices PACKAGES 3) one click order (mobile application) 4) simplification of documentation and payment processes 5) New local brand 6) Additional income source.

The purpose of the platform to be created is to reduce the human factor and time loss in insurance events. Hundreds of road transport incidents occur in our country, especially in the capital city, in daily life. In the event of an insurance incident, the victim or the perpetrator must provide information to both 102 emergency line and to the mandatory insurance company. This process does not take much time, especially considering that a large portion of calls received daily by the 102 emergency line are related to road transport incidents, which creates difficulties for citizens in need of help contacting operators in a timely manner. The personal information of the citizen entering the platform and the information of the transportation vehicle are added to the database. In the event of any insurance incident, the citizen easily informs both DİN (General Directorate of Security) personnel and the insurer by performing 2-3 operations. If there is an injured party, a call to 103 can also be added to this system. Through the integrated map feature in the mobile application, the coordinates of the incident location are determined using GPS and shared with both parties along with the personal information of the citizen. This ensures that police and insurance colleagues in the vicinity reach the incident location without any problems through the navigation system. Through the application, the citizen can monitor information about the assigned road patrol service/insurance vehicle/colleague and the arrival time to the incident location, a practice widely used in many service sectors. The fact that many street names are still the same remains a current problem. Emergency assistance, police, and in the future, if integrated, firefighters can easily reach the scene through the program.
Data collection and database creationTaking responsibility from the 102 service for small incidents and ensuring that more important calls are not kept waitingState and private sector collaboration/ E-governanceSteps taken in our country towards educating about insuranceEntrepreneurship. A certain service fee is charged to the insurer for each call made through the application, and users also use the application by making monthly/yearly payments.

(Ridesharing)
Every day we use transportation as a means of movement. In everyday life, within the city, we resort to taxi services during rush hours, anticipating inconvenience and high prices. Outside urban areas, traveling across the country, we have to use the services offered by local players in the field of transportation, purchase tickets at the bus station, use poorly functional, non-working applications for booking seats for the trip.
Everything in one ? Correct!
Pre-planned trips (Inter-city trips):
Drivers publish their trip by marking the pick-up point - destination; indicating the date; time; number of seats available; price per seat.
Users (passengers) just have to reserve seats in the car.
Regular trips (City trips):
Drivers-
Create a request, determining the start - end of the route.Indicate the number of available seats. The price per seat is automatically determined by a formula (being a program).
User (Passenger) -
Mark the pick-up point- destination; Specify the number of passengers.
The application will automatically calculate the price for each seat, displaying it. (Formula)
The application begins searching for suitable drivers moving in the same direction.
Difference from taxis- The driver determines the route; Not the entire car is booked, but individual seats. A fee is set for each seat. The possibility of picking up passengers (users) at the end of the route.
Advantages:
Ordinary drivers can use the application, offering their free seats for a minimal fee. (Formula)
The platform will contribute to the introduction of the evolutionary concept of 'Booking a ride' for users across the country, integrating the travel process into a single application. The idea will attract not only ordinary drivers but also local players in the transportation market (buses, minivans), private/governmental organizations, and more...
By qualitatively developing the product, the gradual displacement of foreign taxi aggregators from our market is expected.

The idea is universal:
By setting up the right business process, many different segments can be introduced. The goal: Create a platform for co-travelers moving in the same direction.",,,,,UY5NGQ8FyT,,,,,,,,Share your rides!,,

Owners of real estate also face certain problems when selling, as different agents contact them daily or steal their listings, then extort a percentage of the sale.

Our platform will provide verified information about real estate from trusted sellers, and there will also be verification of agents. This will be an entirely new level of buying and selling real estate. Mechanisms for moderating real estate and checking for fraud have been carefully thought out.

Practically all categories, from designers to photographers or copywriters, are in high demand. On the other hand, there are many freelancers, but many of them are unknown or talented beginners. Both sides have a problem of how to find each other because what is currently available in the market - employment agencies, personal pages on social networks, job vacancies on employment websites - is all outdated and no longer effective. The optimal solution to the problem is as follows: it is necessary and possible to create a platform where freelancers will register and showcase their portfolios and recommendations. Also, they will have a star rating from employers. On the other hand, an employer, after registration (free of charge), gets the opportunity to choose a freelancer by the sorting the employer has chosen. A list based on their search will be provided, but in order to access the freelancer's data, the employer must make a payment, for example, for 5 pieces of data - 10 AZN, for 10 pieces of data - 18 AZN, unlimited amount per month - 30 AZN. There will also be an option where the employer can post a job vacancy. 
This platform will thus provide the opportunity to find quality employees, and the employee will be able to see who viewed their profile and raise their candidacy higher in the search for an additional fee. In addition, freelancers will be verified by our specialist to confirm their skills. Constant updates will allow the site to develop on its own, within one year.",,,,,4vXExSBBnk,,,,,,,,#idea #freelance,,

It will also allow electronic signing of contracts and get rid of unnecessary routine, which takes up a lot of time and resources from entrepreneurs.

In Azerbaijan, people use various means of transportation like buses, taxis, trains, etc., to travel for different purposes within the country.

Every day in Azerbaijan, trips are made to different cities and regions for various reasons. Sometimes people with their own vehicles travel alone to other cities and return to their own city, while other people without personal transportation look for a ride. The goal is to connect these people, as they have common interests. People with their own vehicles will be happy if the trip pays off, and those looking for transportation will be glad to travel affordably to another city without buying a ticket at the bus station or dealing with all the hassle associated with the bus station or taxi drivers who charge too much. Such trips have many advantages. It's one thing to travel with a taxi driver, and another to travel with a regular person, you can chat and make the trip more enjoyable. It involves new acquaintances and experiences.

It's all very simple, easier and more transparent. The traveler logs into the app, chooses the city, and can see who is traveling where, at what time, and for how much. A contact is then made for the trip to be completed.

The biggest advantage is that the minimal use of human resources, namely personnel, will be minimal. The customers themselves will do all the work, with the main office remaining to support the application, handle accounting, support clients, and be a leader.

It may seem like an unsuccessful project for Azerbaijan, but on deeper thought, very good ideas come up, it can fundamentally change people's thinking and bring innovations.
I am fully motivated for new achievements, and for this project, I am ready to give my all.",,,,,x2Tn3N09oI,,,,,,,,Convenient travel companion for residents of Azerbaijan and CIS countries,,

Based on many conducted surveys, 95% of buyers reported that they read reviews, 24% of them do so before each purchase. Among representatives of the younger generation (18 to 44 years old), this figure reaches 30%. Usually, when choosing a product that we have never tested before in a supermarket, we try to look at reviews online or ask questions on social networks to rely on reviews about the product or service. On the other hand, some buyers not being able to read instructions for complex equipment also affects the product's purchasing ability. Therefore, ±Rəy online platform/application is the ideal scheme to improve consumer experience based on reliable reviews in the shortest time possible, and to assist global and local brands in sales. But how does this scheme work? Each person writes a useful review about a product or service as a review author, and that review is looked at by people searching for information. The author collects a certain amount per view up to a specified limit. This motivates the authors to write more reviews. Of course, not every review is accepted based on specified rules. Rules for writing reviews are established, and the reviews of authors based on these rules are approved and published. But what is the benefit in this project? Many marketplaces currently join this platform as partners because they lack detailed information or instructions about the product. The links shown on the pages of the reviewed products redirect to the marketplace page, introducing the product on the sales platform. Marketplaces pay a commission for each sale of products/services passed through the ±Rəy platform/application. The more detailed and useful the review, the more views it receives. Even many famous social media bloggers, influencers can work with this scheme and bring benefits to both themselves and this platform. As additional information, the impact of reviews is also confirmed by consumer surveys: It is worth noting that when selecting expensive products, reviews greatly influence the purchase decision under the following categories: Electronics (82%), Household appliances (80%), Computers (80%). In return, we offer a win-win scenario for both buyers and sellers in the development and improvement of products and services. This is not the final offer for this idea. The synergy with many existing projects of the Holding, such as the Umico project, Pasha Travel--reviews, ratings about the featured services, Pasha Bank, Kapital Bank--reviews and ratings about bank products, is also possible. By expanding further, we can turn this idea into our local social network brand and join the cross-border experience in the future.",,,,,xkC3aXVMal,,,,,,,,The win-win scenario for everyone,,

The “Friend's Home” project is aimed at creating essential urban infrastructure within the framework of the “Smart City” concept. The device operates on solar energy. The device not only provides food, water, and shelter for homeless animals but can also be installed in parks, squares, building courtyards, and other public places.
The “Friend's Home” concept, its design, engineering works, and original idea belong to the team of the “Friends Animal Support Agency” project.

The device is developed and prepared based on examples of feeders already used for homeless animals in Ukraine and Turkey, as well as waste collection machines for plastic containers in European countries. Special attention has been paid to both the practicality and the external appearance of the device.
Among the main features of the device are: automatic food and water containers refill; collection of plastic containers for recycling; collection of unused drinking water; shelter for animals; charging capability for phones and other electrical devices; information display; operation with solar energy.

To find a skilled worker who does quality work, we ask a few acquaintances, write in groups. When we find the worker, we contact them, discuss the time for them to come to the house. Sometimes the worker does not come on time or at all, and as a result, the day and time allocated to the worker is wasted. Regarding the price issue, we discuss extensively with the worker, sometimes there are also 'surprises' in the prices discussed after the repair. Imagine a mobile app where you can do all of these with a click. In this application, where craftsmen are also gathered like taxi apps, you can directly call the craftsmen to your home. In the AzRemont application, you enter, select from the available list of workers, read customer reviews and ratings about the worker, choose the available time slot that suits you. You can also see the standard service prices of the worker. For this, you just need to download the application and register. It is possible to solve several existing problems through the application:1) You are not forced to search for a worker - we prevent time loss2) Easy selection from suitable time slots - we prevent time loss3) You ensure the quality of the worker's work through customer reviews - we prevent money loss4) Since the standard service prices determined by the workers prevent surprises - we prevent time and money lossAs you know, successful businesses are built on solving problems. Because this start-up solves the problems mentioned above, there is a possibility of success.As a business model, I think we can take a certain percentage on the displayed service prices (like freelance job systems). As service agreements (transactions) increase on the program, we will also make more profit.As the product roadmap, by expanding the range of services in the future, we can attract craftsmen in different service areas. I have in mind craftsmen such as blacksmiths, plumbers, etc., who are needed from project to project. In this case, even people who have construction work done actively search for such workers during the project. By attracting such workers to the program, we can expand the service range. In addition, in the future, we can turn the program into a digital market for repair and construction products, where people can benefit from both skilled services and materials.There are two concerns regarding the product, the incapacity of the workers to use such a system and payment issues. I think we can solve the first issue by simply setting up the system on mobile with a simple UX/UI. The second issue depends on some tests. Taking into account tax and payment channels, we need to carry out various tests to find optimal methods.",,,,,skkg1ArSgi,,,,,,,,"If you need repairs, AzRemont is just a skilled click away",,

Some of them have official websites and openly demonstrate their existing service catalogues on their websites, others don't own websites or own websites but don't show their service portfolio or training catalogues for buyer organizations and individual learners. Some other providers and vendors run their businesses mainly on social network platforms or google ads. On the other hand, organizations and individuals having the need for training have trouble while finding appropriate quality learning in solutions, learning products, training providers/vendors in a structured way. Survey* (conducted in 4 PASHA SA's) shows that Pasha Group companies usually face difficulty in terms of how and where to search for/find quality training providers for their people development purposes. As we know there are a lot of job search platforms for job seekers and employers to search for jobs and post their vacancies. The above-described problem shows there is a need for such a platform for training providers and learning solution vendors on one hand and training searching organizations on the other hand. Four companies (PB, Kapital, PI, PLI) survey data: (average)1) 77.5% of companies apply for external training companies/business trainers to cover internal training needs.2) 1/4 company has a vendor list3) 5 weeks is an average time to find an appropriate training vendor4) Sources used for vendor search: 100% References, 50% Networking, Google, Social media.5) 100% of companies said that they would like to have such training providers marketplace.It is well-known fact that successful business ideas should fill in the gap existing in the market and should solve the customer's problem.

It will be an online collaboration platform that will offer training providers, individuals and companies regularly buying training and learning solutions to create an account totally for free. The platform itself will produce content and value. The business model is suggested to be built on ""attention trade"".

The ""Thumbs up"" or ""5-star"" approach could be applied. This platform could also be understood as an e-commerce platform for training products specifically. Commerce could be run for free or on paid terms. Mobile app version of the platform will be available for easy access and use by individuals.

A concierge is a person or a company(in our case it will be app) that is available to help you in your day-to-day life. Their services can range from planning and booking your family holidays to making restaurant reservations or getting you access to special events. Some concierge companies also provide outsource services. Others might focus on specific segments of services. But summarizing all - they provide you service. Have you ever seen the movie The Grand Budapest Hotel? Remember the guy, who was dealing with any situation through just one call? Had connections all over the world and people ready to give favor? Exactly - the guy who was solving everyone's problems and making their life easier, comfortable and happy. Sounds like something that you can see only in movies? Not at all!&nbsp;The word concierge probably comes from the old French word “comte des cierges.” The comte des cierges was a servant responsible for maintaining the lighting and cleanliness of medieval palaces. Today’s concierge services extend far beyond just maintaining your candles lit. Concierges are highly skilled people who can add real value to your life by taking care of some essential and time-consuming tasks for you. They also have an extensive network to help you get VIP access to some of the most ultra-exclusive events and experiences around the world.Now imagine having your personal pocket concierge that can solve your daily requests and needs? Tickets to SkyBox or VIP seats for ¼ Finals of EURO 2020 at Olympic Stadium? Easy! (did it myself ;) Flowers to your wife? With pleasure! Transfer for your relative to pick them up from the airport? Easy! Booking for a weekend stay at Shahdag? Not a big deal! Even booking you a ski trainer, which is a HUGE deal, (trust me here). Your yearly membership at The Club? Why not? Movie tickets at Cinema Plus, table for lunch or dinner at any Saffron Group restaurants, master class at CASA, entertainment for your kids at Kinderland? Stop me if you can :)&nbsp;Why do you need concierge services?Concierge services are a fairly recent addition to the luxury(and not only) industry; all thanks to the constantly changing business environment, the technological advancement, and the long working hours of the working professionals. Such limitations have resulted in lack of time in the life of the people. They now wish for either more time or someone who can do the work for them while they free their time for the things that matter. Concierge services business model capitalizes on this need.There are three main reasons for busy(and lest agree, nowadays most of us are busy) people to subscribe to a concierge service:To save time: more time to focus on the things that value most, such as career, relationships, family and community;To get exclusive access to private or special events thanks to the concierge’s network;To outsource time-consuming and repetitive tasks.Who will be our customers?Not everyone needs concierge services. Some people like to manage every aspect of their life themselves. But if you’re too busy and want to outsource some tasks, a personal concierge makes a lot of sense. Modern women and men know that time is their most precious resource. When you’re always connected and on the go, your time is the one thing you can never get back. Our customers - will be people who don't take “time” for granted.&nbsp;What will we offer?We offer you an app that will be your personal concierge! Need to book a hotel or table at a restaurant? GRAB YOUR PHONE &amp; CONSIDER IT DONE!&nbsp;In general, we will focus on two categories of concierge services:Personal concierge services: if you want to hire the services of a concierge for yourself.Corporate concierge services: if a company wants to provide concierge services to its employees as an extra benefit.In the beginning stage we will focus on Personal concierge service, and as the project will grow and expand - there will be more need to offer corporate packages as well.&nbsp;Segments of the services that can be launched on beginning stage:Travel arrangements (Hotels, visa, travel packages, tickets, taxi, transfers, bus, metro)Restaurant arrangements&nbsp;Tickets to museums, concerts, theater and ballet&nbsp;Entertainment and sports&nbsp;Insurance&nbsp;Bank services&nbsp;ShoppingSegments of the services that can be launched later:Event management&nbsp;Real estate&nbsp;Medical&nbsp;Life-style (babysitters, housekeeping, laundry, drivers and etc)In the beginning stage we see it as a list of services and offers listed on our platform that can be bought or proceed with a minimum amount of information and time. And by getting more trust and widing the team - we will be able to proceed with more challenging requests.Who can be our partners?Any company providing service. This wineds list of possible partners close to almost all companies in the country!&nbsp;Examples of partners and offers:Pasha Travel - Booking the tours and packages within an app. You can always customize the offer by asking to change specific sections. And voila - you are getting ready products without standing in traffic at the Gagarin Bridge, or looking for a parking lot around :)The Club - Daily pass, monthly or yearly passes. Or maybe massage? Or - squash game with your business partner? All can be booked within the app and no need to call. You will see the schedule, prices and available lots.&nbsp;Kapital Bank - want to change your BirKart or order a new one? Fill all needed info, ask for delivery and press the button “order” - and it's that easy! Agree, no one likes to wait hours to see “K100500” on the screen :)Why Umico Concierge?First of all, we were thinking of calling this project - PASHA Concierge, but this would limit our offers only to companies that are included in the holding. This is why we choose to go with Umico Concierge. Umico is a company that gained trust from clients and partners - in loyalty, bank and of course - marketplace. Nowadays the Umico app is downloaded in almost all phones in the country, and being used not only as a loyalty program, but is very popular as a marketplace as well! Company has experience in loyalty systems, retail, logistics and banking. What a great combination for such a project? :) Thats why, we strongly believe that launching this project within Umico - will be a great step into the future not only for this project but also in widing the company itself.The Future Of Concierge Services:&nbsp;Mobile devices and the internet have changed the way concierges work. Today, a person residing in New York can ask his personal assistant residing in India to plan his trip to Egypt. All this can be done seamlessly with just one text message.The industry is also not untapped and or under-marketed anymore. The developed technology has included AI to concierges, which has led to this industry opening gates to medium-level income clients.Google assistant has all the plans to become your personal concierge. Assist is a famous automated assistant for messaging and voice. Haptik is building conversational AI for the world. Even Amazon has capitalized on this new trend with the introduction of Alexa. And event in Russia - Alisa product of Yandex is a  great example. But lets leave those heartless machines fo future.

In the simplest case, we create templates in the bank application we use and make payments of the same amount every month. However, this does not allow us to be informed in a timely manner about all our liabilities and to easily make payments. Therefore, by using tools such as bank applications, payment terminals, websites, etc., we make our payments. I suggest that we establish a system called the Central Liability System (in any of our banks), where we reflect all of a person's liabilities within the country on one screen based on unique indicators such as the person's FIN code, phone number, etc. We can implement this by setting up APIs that send debt inquiries similar to the architecture of Milliön. By connecting these APIs with banks, government institutions, electronic stores, internet and phone services, etc., we can gather all of a person's liabilities within the country based on a unique code on one screen and create an easy pay option. The second issue here is that with the Birkart strategy, a person should be able to be given credit based on the volume of his debt. That is, let's say a person logs into the system and sees that he has an actual debt of 82 manats. We provide him with an 82 manat easy pay option, where he directly pays the amount as a credit amount to the customer. The third party of this system is that based on the collected liability data, we can also form a person's overall credit profile. Whether the person wants it or not, all liability data will be available to the bank, which means a lot of data volume for us. Ensuring payments with Umico will create an additional functionality. As a business model, we can also introduce a subscription model for using this service, such as 1 manat per month, or we can be satisfied with the future interest from credit given only with data and an easy option. We can determine the model based solely on tests.",,,,,IC83GVm6P9,,,,,,,,A simple payment channel where your liabilities are consolidated on one screen,,

What Is New?           The purpose of this project is to provide financial services to the financial market in Azerbaijan by analyzing and estimating the risk profile of financial institutions and engaging in consulting. This is meant to be achieved by the means of establishing a website platform that will encompass several premium financial services, which can be selected based on the desire of the customer.             II. Is There Any Demand?           Risk management is a newly emerging section of finance in Azerbaijan. The traditional banking system was built upon credit risk only. However, the scope of risk analysis is broader than that and encompasses the areas such as forex risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, reputational risk, IT risk, operational risk etc. However, there is not enough human capital and practical business experience to establish such a newly developing section of finance. For that purpose, this start-up project can help to solve this problem in the financial market, especially, in the banking industry in Azerbaijan. III. What Does this Project Supply to Market?           1) Risk Health Index (RHI) System:            *One of the main functions of the website platform is to provide the RHI system for premium accounts and general database information for general accounts.           *The RHI system is meant to estimate and track the risk indexes comprised of the ratios from credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, forex market risk, solvency risk, earning and stability.           *RHI will be prepared based on the established methodology and ratios and will be standardly applied for each bank and total banking industry with or without systemic banks.           *The RHI system is meant to analyze each commercial bank individually, across the banks, and against the total banking industry over the time series, at one point in time, for each individual risk segment and total risk segment.           *The RHI system will be prepared based on the quarterly published information of the commercial banks. Every quarter the banks publish on their websites the information related to capital adequacy, financial situation report, profit and loss statement, statement of cash flow, leverage coefficients and statements of changes in equity. This information is adequate enough to prepare the financial risk profile of commercial banks. The quarterly published information can be automated and automatically published on the website platform.           *The RHI system can rank all commercial banks based on their total risk and each risk segment.           *The RHI system will help to establish a risk index for each commercial bank and compare them with their deposit or bond return, and as a result, a risk-return relationship for each commercial bank can be established.           *Tracking RHI for all banks across the time will create a database for the risk analysis.           2) Stress Testing:           *To understand to what extent each bank can bear the difficult situation, for each bank, liquidity, forex, interest rate, and general balance sheet stress testing will be applied.           *The stress testing will be conducted quarterly and published on the website platform.           *The stress-testing patterns will be automated and will be standardly applied to each bank.           *This will help each individual bank to understand the fragility of their current position if an extreme scenario would emerge.           3) Risk Consulting:            *After establishing RHI and stress-testing system in the website platform, and therefore, creating the brand of the project in terms of risk analysis, the team of the project will engage in the consulting in the risk management section for the financial institution.           IV. Who is Market Segment?           The market segment encompasses the legal entities, rather than individual entities. The legal entities include:           1) Financial institutions, especially banks and insurance companies: except for the top three banks in Azerbaijan, the majority of the financial institutions are not successful in establishing their comprehensive risk management system.  	2) Government institutions, such as the Baku Stock Exchange, Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan Banking Association and Azerbaijan Insurance Association have regulative and intermediary roles in the financial market: this project may help them to track the risk of the financial intuitions in a comprehensive manner 	3) Big corporate players and financial institutions that are interested in putting deposits in commercial banks and purchasing the local bonds emitted by the commercial banks: it is expected to be interested in the high interest of big corporate players and financial institutions to analyze the risk profile of the respective commercial banks before engaging in financial transactions and purchases with them. V. How to Generate Revenue and What Are the Possible Expenses:           If the project is established successfully, the following channels are meant to be the provider of the financial resources:           1) Subscription to the platform will require a quarterly fee payment to acquire access to the quarterly estimated RHI index.           2) While establishing the brand in the financial market, the team in charge of the projects will provide risk management consulting services for the financial institutions in return for a financial fee.           3) The website platform will cooperate with financial institutions to advertise their products on the platform in exchange for a financial fee.           4) The platform will constantly conduct surveys in exchange for discounts and financial information to collect the opinion of economic players about the financial market, financial institutions, their products, interest rate etc. The survey results can be used for the benefit of the Pasha Group to understand the domestic market profoundly. Moreover, the survey data can be used as a product of the project to be sold for financial intuitions in exchange for a financial fee based on the established legal terms and ethics.           The possible expenses are the following:           1) Regular payment for the maintenance, update, and IT security of the platform.           2) Monthly wage cost of labor and team members                     VI. Benefits for Pasha Group:           If the project is successfully financed by the Pasha Group, the Pasha Group will acquire the following benefits:           1) Financial benefit: as the shareholder of the project, the Pasha Group will acquire part of the profit based on the established share.            2) Information benefit:2.1) While purchasing the bonds of the commercial banks and deciding to put deposits in the commercial banks, the platform will provide full information about the risk profile of the commercial banks, including RHI and stress tests. 2.2) The data collected from the survey will provide information for the Pasha Group to analyze the market profoundly.           3) Reputational benefit: as the platform will operate under the umbrella of the Pasha Group, it will maximize the scope of business and prestige of the Pasha Group.  VII. Expected Cost of the Project:           The expected cost of the project mainly covers the establishment and development of the comprehensive website platform, which requires the IT services such as back-end, front-end, java developer, designer etc. VIII. Challenges:           The quarterly published information by the commercial banks does not cover the data about operational, IT and reputational risk. This limits RHI analysis and stress-testing to the financial aspects of commercial banks. One of the ways to overcome the mentioned challenge is to establish partnerships with the subscribers and acquire their data based on established legal terms. IX. Short-run and Medium-run Goals:           In the short run, the primary goal is to increase the number of partners as much as possible to ensure the normal operation and functioning of the platform. In the medium run, as the brand in a risk analysis will be established by the project, the project team will start to provide consulting services for the financial institutions.  ",,,,,5J0ANTyI8k,,,,,,,,Providing Risk Management Services for the Financial Market,,

Our idea is to create a platform for signing and sending internal letters and contracts online, rather than on paper. Our Holding supports constant digitalization and transformations, and we want to add value to the Holding by supporting this. Many internal letters within the Holding are sent via courier on paper, such as when customers of Kapital Bank pass away and payment needs to be arranged, letters of application (massive in nature) and their response letters, contracts signed between internal companies of the Holding, reports requested by the Holding in signed form, etc. If the idea is implemented, these letters will be sent electronically, reducing courier costs for the Holding and saving time. Based on information from legal experts we know, if companies enter into contracts among themselves, recognizing that online document exchange can be done via a certain platform, these companies can sign and send and receive documents to each other via this platform. Our proposal is to do this via Jira. Create an additional section in Jira, where contracts are scanned and added, then sent to the person who needs to sign the contract, and once that person approves, the signed contract is automatically sent to the counterparty. Identify to which company and whom it will be sent within the system. We believe that in an era where digital solutions prevail, there is a need for this. A letter sent from one company to another via postal mail may take up to 3 days to arrive, get lost in transit, and so on, but it will reach within just a few minutes through the platform, without additional risks.

1. What do we solve? Companies cannot effectively manage the advantages that will increase the satisfaction and work quality of employees when choosing catering services for employees with diverse tastes and needs, variability in business areas, etc. The selection of vendors that meet these requirements, the management of the supply chain, and the establishment of a control mechanism are facilitated complexly. The yeapp service is a means to eliminate these problems. 2. How do we solve? yeapp allows company employees to individually choose from the menus of various restaurants and catering services. After determining the amount and limit allocated for feeding by the company for employees collaborating with yeapp, employees can dine at restaurants and catering services that collaborate with yeapp within this amount and limit frame. 3. Additional advantages For the company Offering choices to employees increases the satisfaction of company employees with their working conditions. It frees from in-house meal expenses (material-technical base, labor resources, management, certification, legislative requirements, etc.). Prevents the conflict of interest that may arise between the service providers during outsourcing supply. Manages team-building expenses for employees strategically. For employees Regardless of their field, employees can dine at the nearest restaurants collaborating with yeapp and eat at the restaurant that suits their taste. Some people are obligated to choose dietary meals due to various illnesses. Companies cannot offer these choices for each employee. Through yeapp, employees can preview the menus of restaurants and select the restaurant that suits their diet. 4. Business flow (short) Employees can dine in partner restaurants and shops through the yeapp service. The customer company will sign a contract with the yeapp and determine monthly budgets and limits for the feeding of each employee. A yeapp user company employee will go to one of the restaurants providing close services through the program software. After dining, they will make the payment by scanning the QR code in their yeapp profile with the Yeapp scanner of the restaurant. 5. To be prepared Program software modules • Customer (end user) Mobile program software • Partner (Restaurant and Shop) Mobile program software • Customer Company Web platform • Central web management platform The technical assignment of the specified program modules will be prepared together after the employee team is formed. 6. Sales strategy Commission received by partners from yeapp users The commission earned by directing customers to delivery companies The income generated by delivering producer advertisements tailored to the food profile of program users. 7. Market research I queried the service that 2 companies receive for feeding. • X company receives catering services through a service contract in the office. This situation is not an ideal choice for company management and employees. Company X creates conditions for placing the food brought by catering, buying equipment, and reserving a room for the service. • Company Y reported that there are no optimal choices for feeding based on the areas it serves employees who go through exams. Employees must calculate additional bonuses based on the money spent on food. Problems of company employees The company must address problems such as employees getting bored with the company's kitchen or monotonous menus from the catering company and refusing to eat due to food problems. The company is obliged to evaluate and monitor kitchen staff and catering companies.

8. Expansion of yeapp Standard menus will be prepared for yeapp users, and these menus will be sold on-site and delivery through partners. After starting to use yeapp, it will be possible to present target advertisements of partners to users by preparing food profiles of users based on data analysis.",,,,,ARamKf9PTs,,,,,,,,#businesslunch #teambuilding #food,,

Puppy.az will cover the following animal species:
1. Dogs
2. Cats
3. Birds
4. Horses
5. Fish
6. Large reptiles
7. Small reptiles
8. Invertebrates
9. Others

This project has both a social aspect and a business aspect. The social aspect includes:
1. Posting ads for buying and selling
2. Posting when an animal is found
3. Posting when an animal is lost
4. Posting for adoption
5. Posting for mating

With these 5 approaches, this project will be a convenient solution for all animal keepers and other individuals, solving many problems together. In addition to the social aspect mentioned above, there is also a business section. There will be payments for VIP ads, highlighting ads, and creating premium ads.
The following section is dedicated to both Social and Business aspects. For the formation of the list below, payments will be made monthly or daily to be featured on the platform:
1. List of veterinarians - It will also be possible to schedule appointments with the vet.
2. Addresses of Pet shops
3. Trainers

The complete business aspect includes the following:
Sales will be made possible for:
1. Animal feed
2. Animal clothing
3. Medications
4. Equipment (collars, leashes, etc.)
5. Taxi services for animals - Here, it should be possible to transport the animal from one point to another. For example, it will be necessary to transport the animal to the Trainer. By calling a taxi here, there will be a chance to deliver the animal to the specified address. Furthermore, it will also be possible to deliver feed or the sections mentioned above by taxi.

Additionally, there are owners of high-value animals or individuals who are very attached to their animals. We can also offer them the opportunity to insure their animals. Payments can be made with a Kapital Bank card. Additionally, it can be possible to provide a cashback opportunity.
What problems will this solve for us?
1. All animal keepers and lovers will be relieved of the problems they face until now by coming to one platform. For example, when an animal is lost, they post ads on social platforms (such as Facebook or Instagram). But after Puppy.az, these and similar problems will be eliminated.
2. Finding a vet is a difficulty for many people. This problem will also be solved.
3. For finding a Pet shop, they spend a lot of time. Their locations will be accurately displayed on the map.
4. They will see the prices of which feed and have the chance to buy conveniently. Here, medications, equipment, and clothing should also be considered.
5. The taxi service will prevent people from wasting time.",,,,,A7Y6pcLiNx,,,,,,,,Now everything is more convenient,,

For example, if you need a nanny, a master, a nurse, a hairdresser, or transportation-delivery and other services, you can order all of these without leaving your home using an app, and by looking at the profile of the person accepting your order, you can decide based on the service they provide. Users of the program will be divided into two categories: those who order services through the program and those who immediately accept and fulfill the request. The person providing the service undergoes registration in the program, enters the information of their identity card, selects the service category they are capable of, and if necessary according to the category, passes the relevant certification at one of the partner companies, and immediately opens a tax number for work. Of course, every worker is insured, but they bear full responsibility for problems they are guilty of during work (each user is familiarized with this during registration). Each user increases to a certain level their level based on the tasks they fulfill, and when they reach a different level, they receive a surprise gift (this is done to prevent users from committing fraud and to dissuade them from cheating the system). Higher ranked users can receive more orders. Those creating requests can initially create inquiries in these services: Courier services Repair and construction works Office and home cleaning services Transportation IT services Beauty and health services Legal and accounting services Nanny and tutor services Car repairs Veterinary services The advantage of the program is that professionals working in these services can earn additional income outside of working hours.

The establishment of a common platform for the sharing of identification documents among PAŞA Group companies. The following actions are carried out within the framework of the Project: A general contract is concluded for the transfer of identification documents among the group companies participating in the Project. In that contract, shared responsibility is determined for any legal risks that may arise due to the transfer of information outside the Group;A common database is created among the Group Companies (mainly, PAŞA Bank, Kapital Bank, PAŞA Insurance Company ASC, and PAŞA Insurance Company ASC), where the respective identification documents obtained when conducting operations with customers are placed (identification documents of legal and physical persons).When a customer enters into a contract with any of the Group companies (PAŞA Bank, Kapital Bank, PAŞA Insurance Company ASC, and PAŞA Insurance Company ASC) for an operation (insurance or banking operations), they are included in the above-mentioned common data, the customer sees that they are already a customer in another Group Company, and in this case, their identification documents are withdrawn from that common data;To comply with the Law on the protection of personal data, an additional clause is added regarding the transfer of identification information in the initial contract with the customer or in the customer's application requests, the agreement is given for the transfer of information (data can refer to PAŞA Group companies and/or individual companies), when the customer signs the respective request or contract, they confirm their consent for the transfer of information;When the customer applies to another company after their initial operation with one company, if any changes have been made in the identification information, then, the customer's identification documents are updated in the common database (for example, the leader, founder, etc., may have changed during this period).To ensure the security of information during the transfer and the creation of the common database, access to that data by specified individuals only (for example, heads of departments dealing with customers, branch managers, Compliance Service, etc.) can be guaranteed, and an additional liability document is signed concerning the confidentiality with those individuals (colleagues), even financial responsibility may be considered if the information is disclosed.In the event of the creation of a common database in this field, the Group Companies will not only comply with the respective regulations but also increase customer satisfaction levels by not requesting the same documents several times.Note: If the Project is approved, I will add members.

I would like to share the following business idea. Most people are aware of the benefits of electric cars, but there are several obstacles to switching to these cars. One of them is the high cost of cars. I believe that converting a regular petrol car to electric could be more beneficial for people, both financially and in other ways. Let's take a simple example of a car like LADA. By selling a few unnecessary engine parts and providing minimal additional funds, it is possible to equip the car with an electric motor. The customer does not have to go through the hassle of selling the car; they simply hand over the car and receive a renewed vehicle. The entire process, including evaluating and selling unnecessary parts, and installing electric components, will be done in one place. There are currently several methods available. Simply installing the motor or installing ready-made parts called an ""EV kit"" are some of the options. A slightly more expensive method involves installing 4 ""motor wheels"" to make the vehicle's wheels fully powered. It is also possible to place food elements in any desired location on the body. The production of these elements has already started in our country. The remaining engine and controls can be ordered from Russia/China. In my opinion, this method has several positive aspects: - Recycling of vehicles can be done at the national level, - Many people have emotional attachments to their vehicles and do not want to sell them; this method could help such individuals, - For those who cannot afford a new vehicle, - For people who like electric cars and innovation in general, - And for individuals who care about protecting the environment.

Such lessons will enable children to access the most modern chemistry laboratory, create their own robots, learn human anatomy, witness the creation of the Universe, and even touch upon the history of the country. Experiments, tests, and excursions conducted in virtual reality will become an integral part of the future education method that we can create today. Let's take a closer look at how virtual reality is used in preschool, primary, and secondary schools. Virtual reality enriches emotions, complements experiences, helps discover children's hidden hobbies and interests, for example, the ability to explore planets in detail, increase knowledge in the field of space, and create a lifelong attachment to it. More importantly, it makes the learning process intriguing from an early age and fosters the desire to learn from the early stages of life.",,,,,FiZedLcXmD,,,,,,,,The symbiosis of high technologies and education system.,,

The stylistics and design decisions are inspired by a mysterious garden, inspired by the greenery of the northern flora, which erases the boundaries between the city and nature. Vines hanging from the ceiling, forest moss on the walls, colorful furniture made of solid natural wood, handmade dishes and cutlery. The originality of each detail and the absence of a stereotypical division of space embody freedom, as in the jungles, allowing the unique spirit of the author's restaurant based on ethnic motifs to be realized. The basic element of ethnic stylistics is proposed to be taken from Scandinavian aesthetics of countries such as Sweden and Denmark. The interior finishing should include the use of materials such as karobel wood with rough finishing (bar counter, long tables), clay (clay oven), moderate use of marble/volcanic rocks (replacing elements), as well as rare plant species (trees, moss, vines, etc.). It is worth noting separately that the restaurant should have a wine cellar or its imitation (or a room resembling a cellar with glass finishing). Combining glass/crystal with wood will evoke European interiors from 100-150 years ago. Design details will be discussed separately. The dishes should be author's with elements of Scandinavian and Central European (France) cuisine. The idea of adaptation considering local color and design is allowed. A restaurant with a similar concept in Baku has no analogues and can attract both guests with above-average income levels and tourists. The estimated area is 900 - 1200 sq.m. but this is strictly tied to the design! Thank you for your attention.",,,,,0Q370IuSHI,,,,,,,,#eco #restaurant #creativedesigne #GusteSempre ,,

This innovation simplifies the process, reducing the time for transfers and eliminating errors in the transfer process. How does it work? The process of making cross-border transfers through the 'ALIAS' system involves: The sender selects the transfer process; Enters the recipient's phone number, FIN, VOEN, or email; The system searches for the client. If the client is found, the sender is provided with the recipient's nickname and account number; Payment confirmation is made. What is needed for this? At the beginning of the year, the Central Bank launched the Instant Payment System (IPS) based on Open Banking principles. All banks in the country are connected to this service. Bank customers register in this system to facilitate client searches. The search procedure is conducted based on three parameters: For individuals - phone number, FIN, email; For legal entities - phone number, VOEN, email. It is possible to integrate with the Central Bank and gain access to all country clients or exit through a partner bank. Who can be our Partners? Partners can be both partner banks (Sber, PrivatBank, Tinkoff, etc.) and money transfer systems - Western Union, Contact, Zolotaya Korona, UPT, and others. Partners integrate ALIAS into their services and sales channels. What can we expect? The country's total annual turnover for fund transfers exceeds 1 billion US Dollars. The first stage involves transfers between individuals, the second stage involves legal entities. Annual turnover of cross-border transfers by individuals to countries: Russia: over 500 million US Dollars; Georgia: over 90 million US Dollars; Turkey: over 150 million US Dollars; Ukraine: over 60 million US Dollars; Other countries: over 100 million US Dollars; In case of 30% cannibalization with a 0.5% revenue, the revenue will reach 1.5 million US Dollars per year, without considering transfers from legal entities, as well as domestic transfers.",,,,,nlHNvygDSD,,,,,,,,"Cross-boarder transfers by phone number, ID or email",,

In these applications, it is possible to see daily, weekly, or monthly income and expenses. However, using these applications is not that convenient. Adding card information is risky. Also, manually adding expenses in these applications can be tiring. By adding card information with the ""Budget Manager"" app, it will be possible to track payments, view monthly income and expenses. The app will consist of several sections. In one section, income and expenses will be shown in a ""chart"" format. Incomes and expenses will be divided into categories (Food, Shopping, Utilities, Transportation, Lifestyle, Hobbies, Sports, Finance, Investment, Communication, Entertainment, etc.). Payments made with added cards will automatically be reflected in the corresponding category of the ""budget manager"". Additionally, after cashing out from a card, it will be possible to note which category the cash out belongs to through a pop-up window displayed on the app screen. It is also possible to add ""budget goals"" in another section. This serves as an encouraging step for savers. Furthermore, information and special offers can be provided for deposits of securities. In other applications, since incomes and expenses are manual, it consumes time and the ""Chart"" is not properly formatted. In these applications, security risks arise due to their requirement of entering card information. However, with our app, we minimize this risk.

Joint lottery means organizing an internal lottery game by citizens in a traditional way, i.e., collecting a stable amount of money every month, then sharing these funds as rewards among group members. My idea is to create a financial organization by considering this traditional lottery on a single platform/website. Citizens will register with the platform to join the financial organization, learn the respective initial instructions and information, then enter the required document(s) set into the system. All the entered information in the system is thoroughly analyzed by the analytics, mostly focusing on the citizen's financial stability, incomes, work experience (mainly how many years they worked for a company, general growth or decline in their profession, promotion, etc.). Then, a financial liability contract between the registered person and the financial organization is required to be signed. This approach considers engaging the citizen in financial liability and applying the payment protection by the competent authority when the person is unable or unwilling to pay. Additionally, the financial platform will include the following steps:
1) Initially require citizens to provide a deposit in a certain amount. For example, internal gathering like an insurance fund: e.g., collecting money as a fund in the amount of 5 AZN and then utilizing this fund for those who cannot pay.2) Setting a limited number of groups on the system. Initially, groups for the short term (minimum of 5 people, 10, maximum of 15 people) will be created in the system, and the individual will select a group according to their preference and demand.3) Providing the option to join stable payments (minimum 50 AZN, 100 AZN, maximum 250 AZN) on the system each month.4) Carrying out a random draw among group members on the system and distributing this schedule among group members.4) By the 5th of every calendar month, the collection of financial resources from group members will be required.5) Ensuring the fair distribution of the payment among group members according to the schedule on the 10th of every calendar month and ensuring its entry into the account individually.6) It will be possible to earn income by applying a 1% commission from the provided amount to group members each month. It is also possible to organize this approach in other ways. For example, a group of people (10 individuals) under the name 'I wish' wants to acquire an Iphone 12 branded phone. Assuming the market value of this mobile phone is 2,000.00 AZN, each person can present the mentioned phone on a regular basis by participating in a group payment of 220.00 AZN per month (based on the rules mentioned above). In this approach, in addition to earning income from the total group, it is possible to earn income by considering that the mentioned phone is widely accepted in the B to B business approach and getting a certain discount on each phone. This approach can also be applied to other highly demanded household items.
Customers: In the context of a start-up project, the initial customers will include internal employees of the holding, state officials, executives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Customs, Education, Healthcare, Justice, Financial Institutions, and similar individuals.
Duration: minimum 5 - 12 months
Plan for the next steps. In the mentioned project, the evaluation of payment capabilities of certain customers will be assessed in terms of 5-10-15 stars. In the future, creating additional opportunities for individuals who constantly pay with precision within limited frameworks and rewarding them through cash back, gifts, or discounts. Turning these customers into permanent customers. Eliminating customers with weak payment capabilities or any disruptions.",.,"{""label"":""Yes, I do confirm"",""id"":1}",,.,FUnyvP1L3x,.,"{""label"":""Yes"",""id"":1}",,,.,"[{""label"":""Pasha Holding"",""id"":1},{""label"":""PashaPay"",""id"":8}]",.,A suitable financial tool for your development,.,

In addition, when searching for a foreign company or a new entrepreneur in this direction, it is difficult to find a company capable of conducting surveys in Azerbaijan (information can only be obtained through close acquaintances). According to my research, there is a gap in this field, and because the prices are quite high, medium and small companies as well as individuals do not want to benefit from these services, and large companies use them intermittently. By making this service half as cheap, accessible, and in a new style, by directly obtaining answers from people in their chosen categories through the app or website personal cabinet, they will be able to obtain all the necessary chart reports, etc. (Example: PASHA Insurance conducts a survey and requires only drivers with a valid license, aged 20-50, and individuals owning a transportation vehicle from 2015 onwards to answer this survey, or a new foreign or local women's beauty and health center is established, needing to conduct a survey of 10,000 people for market research, and requiring female respondents aged 30-70 and married women. People have already culturally accustomed to receiving VAT refund umico and similar bonus money earning forms. By joining our app and participating in some surveys where they live, visit, or work, they will earn money. (It is possible to link this money to a VAT or Capital bank account system) There are many ways to prevent fraud. For example: identification with a mobile number or ID card, implementing Machine Learning in subsequent stages, etc. In the initial stage, it is necessary to send questions to users through the app we developed, in order to earn money and obtain all data related to the person. For example: were they married, military officer, favorite color, driver's license, the area they live in, and so on... As a result of the mentioned project, the current market price will decrease. This will enable companies, organizations, entrepreneurs, etc. to benefit from a cheap and accurate service, and individuals will have an additional income source simply by answering questions. NOTE: After this process is initiated, the budget allocated for surveys across all holdings will be halved, and the transparency of surveys will increase. It is possible to get acquainted with more detailed nuances (revenue, expenses, etc.) in written form. If you have additional questions, please contact us.

The idea of crowdfunding RE is not new or disruptive, yet it's an effective way to take the first steps at bridging the technological gap. At its initial stage, the project will aim to leverage the bank's already established mortgage experience and match it with the Pasha Holdings workforce. Below is a birds-eye view of how the process will happen An App will be created which will let Pasha Holdings employees chance to invest in RE properties within the group; investments can be as little as 50/100 AZN depending on ticket sizeAnother employee(mortgager)  who is looking to get a mortgage will down-pay a mortgage. The bank will let the crowd of investors decide if they would like to invest(fund) from their salaries/savings the potential mortgage.If enough pool is gathered, the mortgager will acquire the house through the bank and continue paying the mortgage as scheduled. Investors, on the other hand, will get their returns with each mortgage payment.At later stages, additional properties can be crowdfunded and potentially put on the blockchain.The reasons why for everyone this would be a win-win situation is, first of all, Banks/Holding are adding liquidity to their balance sheet effectively by taking out the illiquid Real Estate assets, mortgager would potentially get lower interest fees and for the investor's ability to earn high yields while investing as little as possible.",,,https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO6elCsM=/?share_link_id=214472599150,,oy0EsJ3AWZ,,,,,,,, Real Estate Crowdfunding Platform,,

Because writing the full logic of application will be too long :)So, let's start)This application is designed for all people who care about their health. Some kind of medical hub.Basic flow: Users can type his/her symptoms, have the option to pick suggested ones, see that it “might be” and doctors who deal with that “symptom”.- Ability to have chat/video consultations with doctors (They also suggested by app). Schedule time.-Users can upload his/her test results for interpretation. --Doctors have the ability to write prescriptions and user can order them online from pharmacies.-Suggest in-home services provided by several clinics.Age group: 16-65Gender: does not matterMonetising: Commission from consultations, doctors advertisement, pharmacy companies advertisement, data collection, bonuses from additional services (blood tests, examinations) (not in MVP).    Being inside medical insurance (starting from operations and getting more acquired about other issues of it) for almost 5 years gives me a clear view that actions should be taken to facilitate the overall flow. First question call-center operators ask is about what do “patients” complain about. And in many cases patients can not define themselves which doctor they should choose and they do not have the imagination that it could be.Very important note: Application can be utilized not only by insured persons, but also by an ordinary citizens (Прозвучало странно, но ок)) Also we have several platforms to test and to promote new designed application

Typically, about 300 AZN to 800-900 AZN (when enrolled in preparatory courses) are spent monthly on the preparation of a high school graduate. As a result, the preparation period, which lasts 2 or 3 years, financially burdens the family with an estimated amount of 10,000 AZN. Additionally, a certain amount of money is spent on study materials, food, and transportation. From a physical perspective, both the roads tire the students and occasionally going to teachers located in various parts of the city after school lessons can be exhausting, not to mention the risk of contracting COVID. The mental burden is that sometimes parents and high school graduates face difficulties in choosing the appropriate teachers. Since the parents do not participate in the lessons, they remain unaware of the quality and the progress of the child. All of these contribute to a stressful high school life. As a solution, I suggest the ordinary e-abiturient project. This is a special platform that will be used for the preparation of high school graduates. The following features will be available here: professional video lectures of teachers with extensive experience in the field of student admissions; appropriate test assignments after each topic. When not successfully completed, only related video and written materials will be recommended immediately; special education plans for selected subjects will be available in the personal account; parents will have the opportunity to get acquainted with the subjects and results of their children on the platform; each graduate will have the opportunity to request online explanations from teachers regarding topics they do not understand well, either in writing or through online conferences. To save the time of the teachers, this process can be implemented on specific days each month, and the time of the conference can be determined by ""booking"" the teachers. High school students who do not understand the same topics well can also participate in the same conference; special online exam tests will be available monthly to evaluate the preparation of the student; all necessary study materials will be available online. Thus, this approach will lead us to the following results: reducing the financial burden for the families of high school graduates (monthly payment is estimated at around 200-300 AZN); transportation, study materials, and food expenses will be completely eliminated; high school graduates will work with experienced teachers; parents will easily be able to track the progress of the lesson. On the business side, after the platform is prepared, by attracting suitable teachers and curators, implementing appropriate marketing steps, the company organizing this will have its own income. Over the past two years, due to the pandemic, the young generation mainly received education in an online format, but when it comes to classes and rehearsals with teachers, more expenses were incurred. The Ministry of Labor's joint initiative with Coursera, the increasing popularity of Udemy, Netology, and other courses, and the implementation of high school education in an online format have further boosted confidence in this format of education. Considering the experience of the countries of the CIS and the rest of the world, confidence in various online courses is increasing, and their popularity is growing, which is a successful approach. The target audience is students from 9th to 11th grade, living in any region of Azerbaijan, and their parents. Taking all this into account, I would like to join the KickBox project with this very idea. Thank you for your attention.

The idea is designed to meet real needs. An alternative delivery (Post) service. Every day, people send letters or packages from one country to another, or from one city to another. Sometimes the delivery must be very urgent or cheaper. The companies providing this service are both expensive and slow in delivery. For example, there is a document that must be in another country by tomorrow. DHL requires a minimum payment of 50 AZN and 3 business days to deliver this order. These situations disappoint the customer. Instead, it is possible to create an alternative mobile application. The system consists of three people - Sender- Carrier- Recipient. Ordinary citizens fly everywhere daily, for example, from Azerbaijan to Turkey or from London to Baku. For example, a pocket is empty or can carry documents or letters. Let them be greeted at the airport and delivered. The purpose of the ALZO program is to coordinate the Sender and Carrier individuals.

Users can familiarize themselves with existing offers and send applications to several tourism agencies online without the need to visit tourism companies, thereby choosing the most cost-effective offer among the country's leading tourism companies.
Tourism companies, in turn, gain a new sales channel and will try to place ads on the platform used by potential clients across the country.
In the second stage, not only domestic and foreign tour packages, but also hotel reservations, car rentals, travel insurance, and other services can be offered.
1) Contextuality: The idea of a unique (not found in the market) mobile application, where various tour packages from different travel agencies will be concentrated, can be interesting for the Holding as they will have control over the platform and can set the tone and direction of the offers in general. They can be the first to announce special flights, new destinations, expanded travel conditions, and notify users in a timely manner (before other travel agencies) through push notifications and other tools available in the application. 2) Feasibility: Regarding feasibility - half of the work has already been completed: the mobile application for Android is ready, fully operational, and available for download on the Play Market. A unique logo has been developed, a domain has been purchased, promo videos have been shot for presentations to travel agencies and users. Negotiations have been conducted, and over 100 travel agencies have been added to the system, including Pasha Travel, SW Travel, and Baku Holiday Travel, who agreed to place their tours in the application. They were provided with an admin panel, login, and password. What remains to be done is to develop the iOS version of the application and marketing for promotion. 3) Viability: I suggest that travel agencies can advertise for free, at least initially. In the future, the free package can be limited to 10 ads per month, and any excess to be on a paid basis. Then, paid options such as promoting ads to the top (by default, ads are displayed from newest to oldest), highlighting ads in a special box to attract attention, sending push notifications to users (implemented in the application), and more can be offered. 4) Desirability: Demand is very high due to the lack of alternatives in the market. Clients find it convenient to compare multiple offers on one platform. Successful aggregator platforms like turbo.az, bina.az, jobsearch.az, etc., can serve as examples. If this niche is taken in a timely manner and a well-crafted and user-friendly product is offered, clients will search for tours only in this application, instead of scouring multiple websites and social media of individual agencies. Here, using filters, clients can specify either the destination, dates, or both, view and compare offers and prices. And since Pasha Travel is a leader in the market, the advantage of choice will clearly be on its side, as Pasha Travel will offer either more for the same price or the same for a lower amount. With the help of our aggregator, the client will see this clearly and we will help them make the right choice.",,,,,fcs9Gb7gcJ,,,,,,,,#travel #mobile #application,,

Pasha Bus is a mobile service that aims to provide customers with the products and services of companies within Pasha Holding (banking products and services, insurance products, etc.) at their location, as well as deliver digital services through digital application channels (When we say digital services, it includes ATMs, Terminals, self-service Cabins for product and service sales, Embosser devices, and other processes-related equipment). The mobile service envisions carrying digital buses to areas with high customer density, limited branches, as well as to the Mountainous Karabakh region (in military areas). The focus is mainly on providing digital services to customers. The values that Pasha Holding will add include: Digital buses will be uniquely designed to match Pasha Holding's identity, which will appeal to customer preferences. By introducing Pasha Bus, we will set a precedent in the country to make holding products and services more accessible to customers, increasing customer satisfaction and boosting sales. Pasha Bus will also contribute to the synergy of internal companies within Pasha Holding, increasing cross-sale opportunities. Digital buses will eventually replace physical branches after a certain period, leading to cost reduction. This will allow us to use buses instead of opening new branches or in place of branches with less customer interaction, resulting in reduced branch and personnel expenses. The values for customers include: Customers will have more accessibility. Customers will be able to benefit from a single digital bus without having to visit branches of different companies within Pasha Holding. In addition to service and product access, they will also be able to use devices such as ATMs and terminals. Pasha Bus functionalities include: Pasha Bus will primarily offer digital services to customers. A universal representative on the bus will be able to sell different products and services to customers. The work schedule will be communicated to customers through the website, app, social networks, and push notifications. Pasha Bus will have a unique and attractive design specific to Pasha Holding. It can be used mainly in regions with high customer density and few branches, or as an alternative in low-customer flow branches, as well as a convenience created for customer use in areas with low customer density. Customers will have access to different products and services of companies within the Holding, as well as cross-product sales.",,,,,Lt40KF35Vs,,,,,,,,We are everywhere.,,

Organizers face difficulties in finding a location, creating appropriate conditions, and so on for holding any event and allocate a certain budget for each event. My proposal is for PH to select a single vacant area within the entire complex and establish all the necessary infrastructure for holding events on that area. For example, there is a football championship within PH and certain expenses are incurred to rent the field. Each institution holds its own championships and incurs rental expenses. If we calculate the expenses incurred by each institution just for football, it is possible to build a stadium within 2 years. Having such a stadium will also contribute to hosting joint tournaments. Additionally, each institution holds specific internal events. For example, Town Hall. Each institution looks for a venue to gather a large audience for the event, and if we combine the rental fees, equipment rental fees, etc., for each institution, it is possible to open a comprehensive event center in 2 years, which will eliminate the need for such expenses in the following years. As a result, each institution will save costs in holding such events. Azərsun Holding has a recreation center in Binə town. There are 40-50 covered gazebos in the recreation center. Each gazebo has a barbecue and places to use water. This facility is not only for Azərsun employees but available to everyone. If a similar place is made available to all companies within PAŞA Holding, employees from different companies will have the opportunity to relax with their families, meet colleagues, make friends, and socialize. This will enhance teambuilding qualities among employees within the holding. If a salesperson from PAŞA Bank relaxes with a salesperson from PAŞA Insurance, the result will be that these two employees will serve their customers faster, more successfully, and with higher quality. As a result, both companies will benefit, and the final result will benefit the Holding. It is impossible to estimate the expenses incurred by a single company for such projects; it will not save costs but rather create additional expenses and the payback will be long term. However, if we combine the expenses incurred by all companies within the Holding for such events, we will see that excessive resources are being spent. By creating a center with the condition to host all kinds of events on a large area, after creating this center, expenses can be reduced by up to 10 times. As a result, events will take place independently, unity will be established among employees, employees will be able to relax with their leaders in one place, and overall expenses will be reduced.",,,,,LCdznop7hY,,,,,,,,Costsave ,,

Other functions - receipt analysis, prescription subscription, basic medical services and barcode scanStage 2: Reservation of time slots for meeting doctors, integration with insurance companiesStage 3: Telemedicine: Consultancy with doctors over video chat (both local and foreign), integration with clinics and hospitals. 
The general idea, is to grasp the empty field in local market - digital pharmacy products. There is no direct competitor in this field, only if not AptekOnline, which is making only delivery of products.
For more info don't hesitate to contact me. 
Sincerely,Huseyn Hajili

Users will be able to choose caretakers based on proximity, brief information about themselves, and ratings. This can be both for a one-day caretaker selection and for long-term needs. Moreover, I propose creating an application that will allow selecting not only babysitters but also pet sitters, plant caretakers, and gardeners. This application will meet the demand of residents living in Baku and surrounding suburbs, village houses, and will fill the gap in the service sector.

They play an irreplaceable role both in the recognition of the company and in its dynamic developments. For these individuals (and for all future colleagues), PMD group can build buildings in certain areas. We can ensure the construction of the buildings through our partnership with PAŞA Bank, Kapital Bank, or the mortgage fund. Once the buildings are constructed, we can provide our employees holding SAC cards with these houses and ensure their loyalty to the company - PASHA Holding. Considering that this will be a first in the Azerbaijani arena, it may also mean a significant increase in the influence of PASHA Holding. In addition, insuring the constructed houses and their residents with PAŞA Insurance can generate additional revenue. Furthermore, the opening of Bravo supermarkets can create additional gains through advertisements by PAŞA Life Insurance and PAŞA Insurance companies.
